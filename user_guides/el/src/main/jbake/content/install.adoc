3.1 Installing the Expression Language Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Expression Language TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* Appropriate JDK_Version
* Expression Language 3.0 implementation under test
* Expression Language TCK Version 3.0

1.  Install the JDK_Version appropriate for the reference implementation
under test, if it is not already installed.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the EL configuration that is under
test. To familiarize yourself with the Expression Language TCK suite and
the JavaTest software before you begin testing with your own
implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the Java EE 7 RI
or the Java EE 7 Web Profile RI.
3.  Install the Expression Language TCK 3.0 software.
1.  Copy or download the Expression Language TCK software to your local
system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Expression
Language TCK software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip eltck-3.0-date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the Expression Language TCK bundle name could be
`eltck-3.0_26-Mar-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `eltck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``eltck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
