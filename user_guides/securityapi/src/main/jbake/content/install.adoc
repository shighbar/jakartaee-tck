3.1 Installing the Java EE Security API TCK Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java EE Security API TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 8
* Java EE Security API 1.0 Vendor Implementation (VI)
* Java EE Security API TCK Version 1.0

1.  Install the Java SE 8 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 8 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the Java EE Security 1.0 configuration
that is to be tested. To familiarize yourself with the Java EE Security
API TCK suite and test environment before you begin testing with your
own implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the Java EE
Security 1.0 RI.
3.  Install the Java EE Security 1.0 TCK software.
1.  Copy or download the Java EE Security software to your local system. 
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Java EE
Security software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip securityapitck-1.0-date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the Java EE Security bundle name could be
`securityapitck-1.0_17-Aug-2017.zip`. +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `securityapitck` directory is created.
The install_directory`/``securityapitck` directory is the test suite
home, `<TS_HOME>`.
