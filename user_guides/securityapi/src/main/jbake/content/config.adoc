4 Setup and Configuration
-------------------------

This chapter describes how to set up the Java EE SecurityAPI TCK and
JavaTest harness software and how to configure. Before proceeding with
the instructions in this chapter, be sure to install all required
software as described in link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3,
"Installation."]

After completing the instructions in this chapter, proceed to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests,"] for instructions on
running the Java EE Security TCK.

This section describes how to configure the Java EE Security TCK for
your environment. After configuring your environment, continue with the
instructions in link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, use the appropriate separator
for your operating system when specifying multiple path entries (`;` on
Windows, `:` on Solaris/Linux).

4.1 To Configure Your Environment for the Java EE Security API TCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
1.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE 8 is installed
2.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the Java EE Security TCK 1.0
software is installed
3.  `PATH` to include the `<TS_HOME>/bin` , `JAVA_HOME/bin,` and
`<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin` directories
2.  Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and modify the following
properties:
1.  Set `securityapi.classes` to include all necessary JAR files that
pertain to your implementation.
2.  Set `web.home` to the location where the securityapi is implemented.
For example, `web.home=<GLASSFISH_HOME_FOLDER`>.
3.  Set `jdbc.lib.class.path` to the location where the JDBC drivers are
installed.
4.  Set `jdbc.db` to the name of the database under test. Valid values
include: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
derby
mysql
oracle
----
5.  Set `sigTestClasspath` to include any additional classes not
specified with the `securityapi.classes` property.
6.  Set `work.dir` to the default directory in which JavaTest writes
temporary files that are created during test execution. The default
location is <TS_HOME>/tmp/JTwork. +
This property is required for the TCK Ant targets.
7.  Set `report.dir` to the default directory in which JavaTest creates
a test report for the most recent test run. The default location is
<TS_HOME>/tmp/JTreport. +
This property is a required property for the TCK Ant targets; it must be
set. To disable reporting, set the `report.dir` property to `"none"`.
8.  If you are testing against the default UnboundID LDAP server that is
bundled with the TCK (recommended), make sure the following properties
are set: +
`ldap.server=unboundid` +
`ldap.install.server=true` +
`ldap.ldif.file=${ts.home}/bin/ldap.ldif` +
If you are testing against a different LDAP server, then set the
following property: +
`ldap.install.server=false` +
For a non-default LDAP, you must manually install the server on the
local machine, and configure it to listen on port 11389. You will also
need to load the test data by importing the file
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ldap.ldif`.
3.  [[BABGIFCH]] +
Start the database under test.
4.  Ensure that no process is using port 11389. If you are not using the
default LDAP server, start the LDAP server under test.
5.  Initialize the Vendor Implementation (server, database, and LDAP). +
Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the following
command. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant config.vi
ant init.ldap
----
6.  Deploy all the server packages for testing. To do so, execute the
following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant deploy.all
----
