3.1 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK
tests, you need to install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 6 or Java SE 7
* Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages 1.2 implementation under
test
* Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK Version 1.2

1.  Install the Java SE 6 or Java SE 7 software, if it is not already
installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 6 or Java SE 7 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JSTL configuration that is under
test. To familiarize yourself with the Standard Tag Library for
JavaServer Pages TCK suite and the JavaTest software before you begin
testing with your own implementation, you can optionally do a trial run
using the Java EE 7 RI or the Java EE 7 Web Profile RI.
3.  Install the Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK 1.2
software.
1.  Copy or download the Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK
software to your local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Standard
Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jstltck-1.2_date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the Standard Tag Library for JavaServer Pages TCK
bundle name could be `jstltck-1.2_26-Mar-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `jstltck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/jstltck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
