3.1 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java Message Service TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 7
* Java Message Service 2.0 implementation under test
* Java Message Service TCK Version 2.0

1.  Install the Java SE 7 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 7 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JMS implementation that is under
test. To familiarize yourself with the Java Message Service TCK suite
and the JavaTest software before you begin testing with your own
implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the JMS 2.0 RI
or the Oracle Open Message Queue Version 5.0 product.
3.  Install the Java Message Service TCK 2.0 software.
1.  Copy or download the Java Message Service TCK software to your local
system. 
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Java
Message Service TCK software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jmstck-2.0_dd-Mmm-YYYY.zip
----
where dd indicates the day, Mmm indicates the month, and YYYY indicates
the year in which the TCK bundle was created. For example, the JMS TCK
bundle name could be `jmstck-2.0_15-May-2013.zip`. +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `jmstck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``jmstck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
