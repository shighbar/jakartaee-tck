[[TCJMS103]]

This chapter provides an overview of the principles that apply to
Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) and describes the Java Message
Service TCK. It also includes a high level description of what you need
to do to begin using the JMS TCK.

This chapter contains the following sections:

1.1 Compatibility Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compatibility testing differs from traditional product testing in a
number of ways. The focus of compatibility testing is to test those
features and areas of an implementation that are likely to differ across
other implementations, such as those features that:

* Rely on hardware or operating system-specific behavior
* Are difficult to port
* Mask or abstract hardware or operating system behavior

Compatibility test development for a given feature relies on a complete
specification and reference implementation for that feature.
Compatibility testing is not primarily concerned with robustness,
performance, or ease of use.

[[GBFQN]][[TCJMS00053]][[why-compatibility-testing-is-important]]

1.1.1 Why Compatibility Testing is Important
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java platform compatibility is important to different groups involved
with Java technologies for different reasons:

* Compatibility testing ensures that the Java platform does not become
fragmented as it is ported to different operating systems and hardware
environments.
* Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the Java
programming language, allowing them to write applications once and then
to deploy them across heterogeneous computing environments without
porting.
* Compatibility testing allows application users to obtain applications
from disparate sources and deploy them with confidence.
* Conformance testing benefits Java platform implementors by ensuring a
level playing field for all Java platform ports.

[[GBFPR]][[TCJMS00054]][[tck-compatibility-rules]]

1.1.2 TCK Compatibility Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility criteria for all technology implementations are embodied
in the TCK Compatibility Rules that apply to a specified technology.
Each TCK tests for adherence to these Rules as described in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Java Message Service 2.0
Certification"].

[[GBFPW]][[TCJMS00055]][[tck-overview]]

1.1.3 TCK Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A TCK is a set of tools and tests used to verify that a licensee's
implementation of the technology conforms to the applicable
specification. All tests in the TCK are based on the written
specifications for the Java platform. A TCK tests compatibility of a
licensee's implementation of the technology to the applicable
specification of the technology. Compatibility testing is a means of
ensuring correctness, completeness, and consistency across all
implementations developed by technology licensees.

The set of tests included with each TCK is called the test suite. Most
tests in a TCK's test suite are self-checking, but some tests may
require tester interaction. Most tests return either a Pass or Fail
status. For a given platform to be certified, all of the required tests
must pass. The definition of required tests may change from platform to
platform.

The definition of required tests will change over time. Before your
final certification test pass, be sure to download the latest Exclude
List for the TCK you are using.

[[GBFPB]][[TCJMS00056]][[java-community-process-jcp-program-and-compatibility-testing]]

1.1.4 Java Community Process (JCP) Program and Compatibility Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the
open process used since 1995 to develop and revise Java technology
specifications in cooperation with the international Java community. The
JCP program specifies that the following three major components must be
included as deliverables in a final Java technology release under the
direction of the responsible Expert Group:

* Technology Specification
* Reference Implementation
* Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)

For further information about the JCP program, go to Java Community
Process (`http://jcp.org/en/home/index`).

[[GBFQR]][[TCJMS00033]][[about-the-java-message-service-tck-2.0]]

1.2 About the Java Message Service TCK 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java Message Service TCK 2.0 is a portable, configurable, automated
test suite for verifying the compatibility of a licensee's
implementation of the JMS 2.0 Specification.

[[GBFQV]][[TCJMS00057]][[java-message-service-tck-specifications-and-requirements]]

1.2.1 Java Message Service TCK Specifications and Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following requirements and specifications apply to the JMS TCK 2.0:

* Specification Requirements: Software requirements for a JMS
implementation are described in detail in the JMS 2.0 Specification.
Links to the JMS specification and other product information can be
found at `http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=343`.
* JMS Version: The JMS TCK 2.0 is based on the JMS Specification,
Version 2.0.
* Reference Implementation: The Reference Implementation (RI) for JMS
can be used with
any container that meets the minimum requirements for a container as
defined in the JMS 2.0 Specification. The JMS 2.0 APIs have also been
integrated into the Java EE 6 RI, which is available from Java Licensee
Engineering. +
See the Java Message Service TCK 2.0 Release Notes for more specific
information about JDK version requirements, supported platforms,
restrictions, and so on.

[[GBFSQ]][[TCJMS00058]][[jms-tck-components]]

1.2.2 JMS TCK Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JMS TCK 2.0 includes the following components:

* JavaTest harness version 4.4.1 and related documentation.
* JMS TCK signature tests check that all public APIs are supported
and/or defined as specified in the JMS Version 2.0 implementation under
test.
* API tests for all of the packages comprising the required class
libraries for Java Message Service 2.0. +
See link:rules.html#BABJEJID[Libraries for Java Message Service Version
2.0] for a complete list of the class libraries in these packages.
* End-to-end tests that demonstrate compliance with the Java Message
Service 2.0 specification.

[[GBFSA]][[TCJMS00059]][[javatest-harness]]

1.2.3 JavaTest Harness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest harness version 4.4.1 is a set of tools designed to run and
manage test suites on different Java platforms. The JavaTest harness can
be described as both a Java application and a set of compatibility
testing tools. It can run tests on different kinds of Java platforms and
it allows the results to be browsed online within the JavaTest GUI, or
offline in the HTML reports that the JavaTest harness generates.

The JavaTest harness includes the applications and tools that are used
for test execution and test suite management. It supports the following
features:

* Sequencing of tests, allowing them to be loaded and executed
automatically
* Graphic user interface (GUI) for ease of use
* Automated reporting capability to minimize manual errors
* Failure analysis
* Test result auditing and auditable test specification framework
* Distributed testing environment support

To run tests using the JavaTest harness, you specify which tests in the
test suite to run, how to run them, and where to put the results as
described in Chapter 4.

[[GBFRA]][[TCJMS00060]][[tck-compatibility-test-suite]]

1.2.4 TCK Compatibility Test Suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The test suite is the collection of tests used by the JavaTest harness
to test a particular technology implementation. In this case, it is the
collection of tests used by the JMS TCK 2.0 to test a JMS 2.0
implementation. The tests are designed to verify that a licensee's
runtime implementation of the technology complies with the appropriate
specification. The individual tests correspond to assertions of the
specification.

The tests that make up the TCK compatibility test suite are precompiled
and indexed within the TCK test directory structure. When a test run is
started, the JavaTest harness scans through the set of tests that are
located under the directories that have been selected. While scanning,
the JavaTest harness selects the appropriate tests according to any
matches with the filters you are using and queues them up for execution.

[[GBFSH]][[TCJMS00061]][[exclude-lists]]

1.2.5 Exclude Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each version of a TCK includes an Exclude List contained in a `.jtx`
file. This is a list of test file URLs that identify tests which do not
have to be run for the specific version of the TCK being used. Whenever
tests are run, the JavaTest harness automatically excludes any test on
the Exclude List from being executed.

A licensee is not required to pass, or even run, any test on the Exclude
List. The Exclude List file, `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jtx`, is included in the
JMS TCK.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You should always make sure you are using an up-to-date copy of the
Exclude List before running the JMS TCK to verify your implementation.

=======================================================================


A test might be in the Exclude List for reasons such as:

* An error in an underlying implementation API does not allow the test
to execute properly.
* The specification upon which the test was based has an error.
* The test itself has an error.
* The test fails due to a bug in the tools, such as the JavaTest
harness, for example.

In addition, all tests are run against the reference implementations.
Any tests that fail when run on a reference Java platform are put on the
Exclude List. Any test that is not specification-based, or for which the
specification is vague, may be excluded. Any test that is found to be
implementation dependent (based on a particular thread scheduling model,
based on a particular file system behavior, and so on) may be excluded.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Licensees are not permitted to alter or modify Exclude Lists. Changes to
an Exclude List can only be made by using the procedure described in
link:rules.html#BABFGICJ[Java Message Service Version 2.0 Test Appeals
Process].

=======================================================================

1.2.6 JMS TCK Configuration Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to set several variables in your test environment, modify
properties in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file, and then use the JavaTest
harness to configure and run the JMS tests, as described in
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration"].
