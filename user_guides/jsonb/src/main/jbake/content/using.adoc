5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JSON-B TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the
test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting JavaTest"]
* link:#BCGHEIBB[Section 5.2, "Running All of the JSON-B TCK Tests"]
* link:#GBFWM[Section 5.3, "Running a Subset of the Tests"]
* link:#GBFVK[Section 5.4, "Test Reports"]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "JSON-B TCK Setup and Configuration"],
respectively.

=======================================================================

5.1 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the JSON-B TCK using the JavaTest
harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI
* From the command line in your shell environment

[[GBFWH]][[TCCOA00014]][[to-start-javatest-in-gui-mode]]

5.1.1 To Start JavaTest in GUI Mode

----
Just the client test `testJsonbDateFormat` in the `annotation` directory
will be run.

[[GBFVL]][[TCCOA00018]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.3.4 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`.

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the JSON-B tests with a status of failed
and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonb
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

[[GBFVK]][[TCCOA00043]][[test-reports]]

5.4 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.

5.4.1 Creating Test Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following modes to create test reports:

* link:#GBFVH[Section 5.4.1.1, "To Create a Test Report in GUI Mode"]

[[GBFVH]][[TCCOA00019]][[to-create-a-test-report-in-gui-mode]]

5.4.1.1 To Create a Test Report in GUI Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, select Report, then select Create
Report. +
You are prompted to specify a directory to use for your test reports.
The default location is
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetests/jsonb`.
2.  Specify the directory you want to use for your reports, then select
OK. +
Use the Filter list to specify whether you want to generate reports for
the current configuration, all tests, or a custom set of tests. +

[[GBFVC]][[TCCOA00020]][[to-create-a-test-report-in-command-line-mode]]

5.4.1.2 To Create a Test Report in Command-Line Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specify where you want to create the test report.

1.  To specify the report directory from the command line at runtime,
use: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dreport.dir="report_dir"
----
Reports are written for the last test run to the directory you specify.
The default location is
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetests/jsonb`.
2.  To specify the default report directory, set the `report.dir`
property in `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`. +
For example, `report.dir="/home/josephine/reports"`.
3.  To disable reporting, set the `report.dir` property to `"none"`,
either on the command line or in `ts.jte`. +
For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dreport.dir="none"
