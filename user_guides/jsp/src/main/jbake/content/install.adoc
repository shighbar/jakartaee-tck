3.1 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the JavaServer Pages TCK tests, you need to install
and set up the following software components:

* Appropriate Java SE 7
* JavaServer Pages 2.3 implementation under test
* JavaServer Pages TCK Version 2.3

1.  Install the <Java SE 7> appropriate for the reference implementation
under test, if it is not already installed.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JavaServer Faces configuration that
is under test. To familiarize yourself with the JavaServer Pages TCK
suite and the JavaTest software before you begin testing with your own
implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the Java EE 7 RI
or the Java EE 7 Web Profile RI.
3.  Install the JavaServer Pages TCK 2.3 software.
1.  Copy or download the JavaServer Pages TCK software to your local
system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the JavaServer
Pages TCK software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jsptck-2.1_date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the JavaServer Pages TCK bundle name could be
`jsptck-2.1_26-Mar-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `jsptck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``jsptck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
