4.3 Using the JavaTest Harness Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK test
suite using the JavaTest harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI; if using this method, please continue on to
link:#GBFWG[Section 4.4, "Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration
GUI."]
* In JavaTest batch mode, from the command line in your shell
environment; if using this method, please proceed directly to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]

Before you start the JavaTest harness software, you must have a valid test suite and
J2SE SDK 1.4.1 installed on your system. +
The {TechnologyShortName} TCK includes an Ant script that is used to execute the JavaTest
harness from the `<TS_HOME>` directory. Using this Ant script to start the JavaTest
harness is part of the procedure described in Section “The Configuration
Interview." +
When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the JavaTest
harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through the initial startup
configuration. +

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a Welcome to
JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of either opening an
existing work directory or creating a new work directory as described in the
JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a Welcome to
JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of opening both a test
suite and a work directory as described in the JavaTest documentation.
After you specify a work directory, you can use the Test Manager to configure and
run tests as described in Section “The Configuration Interview.”


[[GBFWG]][[using-the-javatest-harness-configuration-gui]]

4.4 Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the JavaTest harness GUI to modify general test settings and
to quickly get started with the default {TechnologyShortName} TCK test
environment.  This section covers the following topics:

* link:#GBFVA[Configuration GUI Overview]
* link:#GBFVD[Starting the Configuration GUI]
* link:#GBFVX[To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK Tests]
* link:#GBFUU[Modifying the Default Test Configuration]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It is only necessary to proceed with this section if you want to run the
JavaTest harness in GUI mode. If you plan to run the JavaTest harness in
command-line mode, skip the remainder of this chapter, and continue with
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]

=======================================================================


[[GBFVA]][[configuration-gui-overview]]

4.4.1 Configuration GUI Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured. The
JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment: This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

The first time you run the JavaTest harness software, you are asked to
specify the test suite and work directory that you want to use. (These
parameters can be changed later from within the JavaTest harness GUI.)

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Start,
then Run Tests to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness determines
whether all of the required configuration information has been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview. When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

[[GBFVD]][[starting-the-configuration-gui]]

4.4.2 Starting the Configuration GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start the JavaTest harness software, you must have a valid
test suite and Java SE {SEversion} installed on your system.

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK includes an Ant script that is used to execute the
JavaTest harness from the `<TS_HOME>` directory. Using this Ant script
to start the JavaTest harness is part of the procedure described in
link:#GBFVX[Section 4.4.3, "To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the
TCK Tests."]

When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the
JavaTest harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through
the initial startup configuration.

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
either opening an existing work directory or creating a new work
directory as described in the JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
opening both a test suite and a work directory as described in the
JavaTest documentation.

After you specify a work directory, you can use the Test Manager to
configure and run tests as described in link:#GBFVX[Section 4.4.3, "To
Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the TCK Tests."]

[[GBFVX]][[to-configure-the-javatest-harness-to-run-the-tck-tests]]

4.4.3 To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions
are specific to your site. For example, the name of the host on which
the JavaTest harness is running. Other configuration parameters can be
set however you wish. For example, where you want test report files to
be stored.

Note that you only need to complete all these steps the first time you
start the JavaTest test harness. After you complete these steps, you can
either run all of the tests by completing the steps in
link:using.html#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting JavaTest,"] or run a subset
of the tests by completing the steps in link:using.html#GBFWM[Section
5.2, "Running a Subset of the Tests."]

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and start the JavaTest test
harness: +
`cd <TS_HOME>/bin` +
`ant gui`
2.  From the File menu, click Open Quick Start Wizard. +
The Welcome screen displays.
3.  Select Start a new test run, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to create a new configuration or use a configuration
template.
4.  Select Create a new configuration, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to select a test suite.
5.  Accept the default suite (`<TS_HOME>/src`), and then click Next. +
You are prompted to specify a work directory to use to store your test
results.
6.  Type a work directory name or use the Browse button to select a work
directory, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to start the configuration editor or start a test run.
At this point, the {TechnologyShortName} TCK is configured to run the
default test suite.
7.  Deselect the Start the configuration editor option, and then click
Finish.
8.  Click Run Tests, then click Start. +
The JavaTest harness starts running the tests.
9.  To reconfigure the JavaTest test harness, do one of the following:
* Click Configuration, then click New Configuration.
* Click Configuration, then click Change Configuration.
10. Click Report, and then click Create Report.
11. Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
12. Click Yes to view the report.

[[GBFUU]][[modifying-the-default-test-configuration]]

4.4.4 Modifying the Default Test Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest GUI enables you to configure numerous test options. These
options are divided into two general dialog box groups:

* Group 1: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change Configuration
submenus, the following options are displayed in a tabbed dialog box:

** Tests to Run

** Exclude List

** Keywords

** Prior Status

** Test Environment

** Concurrency

** Timeout Factor
* Group 2: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change
Configuration/Other Values submenu, or by pressing Ctrl+E, the following
options are displayed in a paged dialog box:

** Environment Files

** Test Environment

** Specify Tests to Run

** Specify an Exclude List

Note that there is some overlap between the functions in these two
dialog boxes; for those functions use the dialog box that is most
convenient for you. Please refer to the JavaTest Harness documentation
or the online help for complete information about these various options.

[[GHGDG]][[the-configuration-interview]]

4.5 The Configuration Interview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions are specific
to your site. For example, the name of the host on which the JavaTest harness is
running. Other configuration parameters can be set however you wish. For
example, where you want test report files to be stored.

To configure the JavaTest harness to run the JAX-RPC TCK tests, complete the
following steps. Note that you only need to complete these steps the first time you
start the JavaTest harness. After you complete these steps, you can either run all of
the tests by completing the steps in link:using.html#GBFUZ[Section, "Starting JavaTest,"]
or run a subset of the tests by completing the steps in
link:using.html#GBFWM[Section, "Running a Subset of the Tests,"]

1.  Change to the <TS_HOME>/bin directory and start the JavaTest test harness: +
`cd <TS_HOME>/bin`
`tsant gui`
The Welcome screen displays.
2.  Click `File->Create Work Directory` to create a new work directory.
If you already have a working directory you want to use, click `File->Open Work
Directory` instead.
At this point, the JavaTest harness is preconfigured the JAX-RPC TCK.
3.  If you want to run the test suite at this time using your current configuration
settings, click `Run Tests->Start` from the main menu.

4.6 Special Set-Up Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[GCLJK]][[running-the-jaxrpc-on-vendor-implementation]]

4.6.1 Running the {TechnologyShortName} on a Vendor's Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} specification does not specify any normative model for packaging
and deployment of service endpoints on a servlet container-based {TechnologyShortName}
runtime system. A {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} implementation is allowed
to have a vendorspecific deployment and packaging model for servlet-based service endpoints.
For this reason, the {TechnologyShortName} TCK provides two distribution directories, /dist and
/dist-vi, for the web service endpoint tests.

The /dist directory contains all the WAR files for the {TechnologyShortName} TCK service
endpoint tests that have been compiled and packaged for deployment on a Servlet
2.3-compliant web container using the standard Web Archive (WAR) format. These
WAR files are tailored for use with the Sun Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
Reference Implementation. The web.xml file contains the deployment information that the
web container needs to link {TechnologyShortName} service endpoints to its associated servlet
class. One generic servlet class, com.sun.xml.rpc.server.http.JAXRPCServlet , is
used for all {TechnologyShortName} service endpoints. These WAR files enable you to run,
without any additional setup or modification, the {TechnologyShortName} TCK tests and to test
the various features and functionality of the Sun Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
Reference Implementation.

The /dist-vi directory contains generic JAR files for all the TCK service endpoint
tests that you must use to package and deploy on your {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
implementation in a vendor-specific way. For each of these web applications, you
must use your deployment tool to perform the appropriate Java-to-WSDL or
WSDL-to-Java mapping, based on whether the service endpoint is defined by a
Java Service Endpoint Interface or a WSDL service document. Next, you must
package all the generated artifacts needed along with the service implementation
classes for the service endpoints and deploy them on your container-based
implementation.

The following README files and TABLE show test breakdown and provide
information that should help you with this process

* README.JAVA-TO-WSDL
* README.WSDL-TO-JAVA
* Test Breakdown and Mapping Requirements

These README files contain the manual instructions that you need to perform to
implementation. The files also specify the mapping (Java-to-WSDL or WSDL-to-
  deploy and package the service endpoint tests on your {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
Java) that each test must perform. +
For a brief example of how the Sun Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Reference
Implementation does this, look at the J2WMT.war web application in the the /dist
directory. This test marshalls/unmarshalls all the {TechnologyShortName}-supported Java data
types as outlined in the {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Specification using the Java-to-WSDL
mapping. The web.xml file that is packaged in this web application is as follows:
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://
java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
<display-name>J2WMarshallTestApp</display-name>
<listener>
<listenerclass>
com.sun.ts.tests.jaxrpc.common.JAXRPCContextListener</
listener-class>
</listener>
<servlet>
<servlet-name>XmlServletName</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>com.sun.ts.tests.jaxrpc.common.JAXRPCServlet</
servlet-class>
<load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>XmlServletName</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/jaxrpc/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
<session-config>
<session-timeout>54</session-timeout>
</session-config>
</web-app>
----
As you can see, the {TechnologyShortName} service endpoint is linked to a generic servlet in the
{TechnologyShortName} RI (com.sun.xml.rpc.server.http.JAXRPCServlet). This servlet is
abstracted out in {TechnologyShortName} TCK under common servlet
(com.sun.ts.tests.jaxrpc.common.JAXRPCServlet) which simply extends it. This
common servlet is used for processing, handling and dispatching to all JAX-RPC
service endpoints.
The {TechnologyShortName} TCK Service Endpoint WAR files use a consistent naming convention
for accessing all Service Endpoint URLs and WSDL URLs: as follows.

* For Service Endpoint URLs, the URL mapping follows this convention:
http://webServerHost:webServerPort/ContextRoot/URLAlias/PortName +
The URL Alias used in all JAX-RPC TCK tests is jaxrpc.
* For WSDL URL locations, the URL mapping follows this convention:
http://webServerHost:webServerPort/ContextRoot/URLAlias?WSDL

The example that follows is one of the JAX-RPC TCK tests that shows this
mapping.

The following implementation-specific runtime configuration file, jaxrpc-riruntime.
xml , is supplied as a web archive initialization file to this servlet. This
runtime configuration file is automatically generated by the wsdeploy deployment
tool, which gives information on all service endpoints containing their interface,
implementation and tie classes, their service, port and WSDL document and their
URL pattern for accessing the endpoint.
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<endpoints xmlns=’http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jax-rpc/ri/runtime’

</endpoints>
----
The RPC service endpoint has one port defined in its runtime configuration file.
The test client code accesses this {TechnologyShortName} service endpoint and port at the
following URL location: +
http://webServerHost:webServerPort/J2WMT/jaxrpc/MarshallTest

where MarshallTest is the service port to access.

The above RPC service endpoint WSDL file describing this service is also
published. The test client code accesses this WSDL file based on the above
configuration via the following URL location: +
http://webServerHost:webServerPort/J2WMT/jaxrpc/MarshallTest?WSDL


[[GCLII]][[to-deploy-a-single-test-directory]]

4.6.2 Instructions for Interoperability Test Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test for interoperability between your implementation and the Sun
Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} Reference Implementation, Sun recommends the following
two test scenarios:

* J2WMT
* W2JMarshallTest

Complete the following steps to test interoperability between {TechnologyShortName}
implementations in both directions:

1.  Deploy and run the J2WMT and W2JMarshallTest TCK tests on your own {TechnologyShortName}
 {TechnologyVersion} implementation and perform the appropriate mappings (WSDL-to-Java)
and (Java-to-WSDL)
2.  Deploy the {TechnologyShortName} RI WAR files (J2WMT.war) and (W2JMarshallTest.war)
on a remote host system using the {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion}
Reference Implementation.
3.  On your local host system that is running your own {TechnologyShortName} implementation,
edit the ts.jte file to change the Web server host and port to point to this
remote system running the {TechnologyShortName} RI with the J2WMT.war and
W2JMarshallTest.war WAR files deployed.
4.  Run the client code for these tests against the remote system to test the
marshalling/unmarshalling of data from your {TechnologyShortName} implementaton to the
Sun Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} RI implementation system and back.
5.  Perform the same procedure going in the opposite direction, running the client
on the Sun Microsystems {TechnologyShortName} RI and accessing the Service Endpoint
deployed on your {TechnologyShortName} implementation.
