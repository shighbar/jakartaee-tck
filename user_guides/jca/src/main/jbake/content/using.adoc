5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JCA TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the test
suite. The JCA TCK can be run using either the JavaTest harness software
through the JavaTest GUI or from the command line in your shell
environment.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"]
respectively.

=======================================================================


This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Using the GUI for TCK Test Execution]
* link:#GJCIW[Using the Command-Line for TCK Test Execution]

[[GBFUZ]][[TCCON00049]][[using-the-gui-for-tck-test-execution]]

5.1 Using the GUI for TCK Test Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JavaTest documentation in the Java EE Connector Architecture TCK 1.7
documentation bundle contains more detailed instructions on running and
using JavaTest.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It is only necessary to proceed with this section if you want to run the
JavaTest harness in GUI mode. If you plan to run the TCK tests in
command-line mode, skip the remainder of this chapter, and continue with
link:#GJCIW[Section 5.2, "Using the Command-Line for TCK Test
Execution."]

5.1.2 Configuring the JavaTest Harness in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured. The
JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment: This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

The first time you run the JavaTest harness software, you are asked to
specify the test suite and work directory that you want to use. (These
parameters can be changed later from within the JavaTest harness GUI.)

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Run
Tests, and then Start to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness
determines whether all of the required configuration information has
been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview . When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

5.1.3 To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the JCA TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You only need to complete all these steps the first time you start the
JavaTest test harness. After you complete these steps, you can either
run all of the tests by completing the steps in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1,
"Using the GUI for TCK Test Execution,"] or run a subset of the tests by
completing the steps in link:#GJCHY[Section 5.1.5, "To Run a Subset of
the TCK Tests in GUI Mode."]

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions,
such as the name of the host on which the JavaTest harness is running,
are specific to your site. Other configuration parameters, such as where
you want test report files to be stored, can be set however you wish.

1.  Start the JavaTest test harness. +
The Welcome screen displays. +
If the Welcome screen does not appear, select File and then click Open
Quick Start Wizard.
2.  Select Start a new test run, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to create a new configuration or use a configuration
template.
3.  Select Create a new configuration, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to select a test suite.
4.  Accept the default suite (`<TS_HOME>/src`), and then click Next. +
You are prompted to specify a work directory to use to store your test
results.
5.  Type a work directory name or use the Browse button to select a work
directory, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to start the configuration editor or start a test run.
At this point, the JCA TCK is configured to run the default test suite.
6.  Deselect the Start the configuration editor option, and then click
Finish.
7.  Click Run Tests, then click Start. +
The JavaTest harness starts running the tests.
8.  To reconfigure the JavaTest test harness, do one of the following:
* Click Configuration, then click New Configuration.
* Click Configuration, then click Change Configuration.
9.  Click Report, and then click Create Report.
10. Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
11. Click Yes to view the report.

5.1.4 Modifying the Default Test Configuration in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest GUI enables you to configure numerous test options. These
options are divided into two general dialog box groups:

* Group 1: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change Configuration
submenus, the following options are displayed in a tabbed dialog box:

** Tests to Run

** Exclude List

** Keywords

** Prior Status

** Test Environment

** Concurrency

** Timeout Factor
* Group 2: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change
Configuration/Other Values submenu, or by pressing Ctrl+E, the following
options are displayed in a paged dialog box:

** Environment Files

** Test Environment

** Specify Tests to Run

** Specify an Exclude List

Note that there is some overlap between the functions in these two
dialog boxes; for those functions use the dialog box that is most
convenient for you. See the JavaTest Harness documentation or the online
help for complete information about these various options.

[[GJCHY]][[TCCON00086]][[to-run-a-subset-of-the-tck-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.1.5 To Run a Subset of the TCK Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, click Configure, then click Change
Configuration, and then click Tests to Run. +
The tabbed Configuration Editor dialog box is displayed.
2.  Click Specify from the option list on the left.
3.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, and
then click Done. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively,
or select just a single test.
4.  Click Save File.
5.  Click Run Tests, and then click Start to run the tests you selected. +
Alternatively, you can right-click the test you want from the test tree
in the left section of the JavaTest main window, and choose Execute
These Tests from the menu.
6.  Click Report, and then click Create Report.
7.  Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
8.  Click Yes to view the report.

[[GJCND]][[TCCON00025]][[to-run-tests-that-failed-priorstatus-from-the-command-line]]

5.2.1 To Run Tests that Failed (PriorStatus) From the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests based on the test's prior run status by
specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking `ant`.

1.  Use the keywords command to select the tests for a test run based on
their outcome on a prior test run: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
priorStatus status-arguments
----
The status-arguments that can be used are `pass`, `fail`, `error`, and
`notRun`.
2.  Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` keyword. +
Use commas to separate multiple arguments. +
For example, to run all the tests that had a status of failed and error
during a previous test run, you would invoke the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----
