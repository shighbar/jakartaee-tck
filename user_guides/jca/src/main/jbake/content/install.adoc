3.1 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the JCA TCK tests, you need to install and set up the
following software components:

* Java SE 7
* JCA 1.7 implementation under test
* JCA TCK Version 1.7

1.  Install Java SE 7, if it is not already installed.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JCA TCK configuration that is under
test. To familiarize yourself with the JCA TCK suite and the JavaTest
software before you begin testing with your own implementation, you can
optionally do a trial run using the Java EE 7 Web Profile RI.
3.  Install the JCA TCK 1.7 software.
1.  Copy or download the JCA TCK software to your local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the JCA TCK
software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip connectortck-1.7_date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the JCA TCK bundle name could be
`connectortck-1.7_15-May-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `connectortck` directory is created.
The `<install_directory>/``connectortck` directory is the test suite
home, `<TS_HOME>`.
