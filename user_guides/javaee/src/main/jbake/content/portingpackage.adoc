11 Implementing the Porting Package
-----------------------------------

Some functionality in the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition platform is
not completely specified by an API. To handle this situation, the Java
EE 8 CTS test suite defines a set of interfaces in the
`com.sun.cts.porting` package, which serve to abstract any
implementation-specific code. The CTS also provides implementations of
these interfaces to work with the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI.

You must create your own implementations of the porting package
interfaces to work with your particular Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition server environment. You also need to create a deployment plan
for each deployable component (EAR, EJB JAR, WAR, and RAR files) in the
test suite as defined by the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition platform
and JSR-88. There is a new `getDeploymentPlan()` method on the
`TSDeploymentInterface2` interface, which returns an input stream to
your deployment plan.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Vendors are required to intrepret the `ior-security-config` specified in
the EJB runtime XML file and configure the EJB according to the
specified values. For more information, see link:csiv2logs.html#GEXUI[The
security-role-mapping Element].

=======================================================================


[[GFASD]][[overview]]

11.1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI uses a set of
module-name-with-extension`.sun-`standard-deployment-desc-component-prefix`.xml`
files that are associated with each deployable component. A CTS
`DeploymentInfo` object parses the contents of several runtime XML
files: `sun-application_1_4-0.xml`, `sun-application-client_1_4-0.xml`,
`sun-ejb-jar_2_1-0.xml`, and `sun-web-app_2_4-0.xml`, and makes their
content available to create deployment plans by means of the
`getDeploymentPlan()` method.

To use specific implementations of these classes, you simply modify the
following entries in the `porting class .1` section of the `ts.jte`
environment file to identify the fully-qualified class names:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
porting.ts.deploy2.class.1=[vendor-deployment-class]
porting.ts.login.class.1=[vendor-login-class]
porting.ts.url.class.1=[vendor-url-class]
porting.ts.jaxrpc.class.1=[vendor-jaxrpc-class]
porting.ts.jms.class.1=[vendor-jms-class]
porting.ts.HttpsURLConnection.class.1=[vendor-httpsURLConnection-class] 
----

The `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/lib/porting` directory contains the
interfaces and `Factory` classes for the porting package.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You must not modify any of the CTS VRelease 8 source code. Create your
own implementations of these interfaces and point to them in the
appropriate section of the `ts.jte` file.

=======================================================================


Note the change to the deployment porting property above. It has changed
to be `deploy2`. This is because there is a new deployment porting
interface because of the standardization of a deployment API in Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition. Any functionality that is still not
addressed by this API is part of the new interface
com.sun.ts.lib.porting.TSDeploymentInterface2.

Make sure your porting class implementations meet the following
requirements:

* Implement the following porting interfaces:

** `TSDeploymentInterface2`

** `TSLoginContextInterface`

** `TSURLInterface`

** `TSJMSAdminInterface`

** `TSHttpsURLConnectionInterface`

** `TSJAXRPCInterface`
* Include the implementation of the previous interfaces in the
classpaths of JavaTest, the test clients, and the test server
components:

** In the `ts.harness.classpath` property in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file

** In the `CLASSPATH` variable of the `command.testExecute` and
`command.testExecuteAppClient` properties in the `ts.jte` file

** In the classpath of your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server

Note that because the JavaTest VM calls certain classes in the CTS
porting package directly, porting class implementations are not
permitted to exit the VM (for example, by using the `System.exit` call).

11.2 Porting Package APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections describe the API in the Java EE 8 CTS porting
package. The implementation classes used with the Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition RI are located in the
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/lib/implementation/sun/javaee` directory. You
are encouraged to examine these implementations before you create your
own.

Detailed API documentation for the porting package interfaces is
available in the `<TS_HOME>/docs/api` directory. The API included in
this section are:

* link:#GFASM[TSDeploymentInterface2]
* link:#GKLJO[Ant-Based Deployment Interface]
* link:#GFASI[TSJMSAdminInterface]
* link:#GFATH[TSLoginContextInterface]
* link:#GFATO[TSURLInterface]
* link:#GFASJ[TSHttpsURLConnectionInterface]
* link:#GFAUI[TSJAXRPCInterface]

[[GFASM]][[tsdeploymentinterface2]]

11.2.1 TSDeploymentInterface2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java EE 8 CTS test suite provides a new version of the Deployment
porting interface. With the introduction of a standard deployment API in
the J2EE 1.4 platform (via JSR-88), many of the porting methods in the
original interface `TSDeploymentInterface` no longer require
implementation-specific functionality. The Java EE 8 CTS test suite
provides an implementation of the interface `TSDeploymentInterface`,
which uses only the standard Deployment APIs defined by the Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition platform. The following properties are
still in the `ts.jte` file to reflect this and should not be changed:

* `porting.ts.deploy2.class.1=com.sun.ts.lib.deliverable.cts.deploy.StandardDeployment14`
* `porting.ts.deploy2.class.2=com.sun.ts.lib.deliverable.cts.deploy.StandardDeployment14`

The class `StandardDeployment14` also requires the following properties
to be set in the `ts.jte` file:

* `deployManagerJarFile.1=${JAVAEE_HOME}/lib/deployment/sun-deploy.jar`
* `deployManageruri.1=deployer:Sun:AppServer:RI::localhost`
* `deployManageruname.1=foo`
* `deployManagerpasswd.1=bar`

These properties are necessary in order to get an instance of and
interact with the `DeploymentManager` for your Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition implementation.

The `deployManagerJarFile` property must point to the JAR file that
contains the manifest entries necessary to get your `DeploymentManager`
instance. The `deployManageruri` property represents the URI that is
used to locate your `DeploymentManager`.

The `deployManageruname` and `deployManagerpasswd` properties are used
when calling `DeploymentFactoryManager.getDeploymentManager`.

`StandardDeployment14` calls into the new deployment porting interface
(`TSDeploymentInterface2`). Licensees must implement this new interface
and set the following property in the `ts.jte` file to point to their
implementation:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
porting.ts.deploy2.class.1=com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.JavaEE.SunRIDeployment2 
----

The `TSDeployment2` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating
concrete implementations of `TSDeploymentInterface2`. The concrete
implementations are specified by the `porting.ts.deploy2.class.1` and
`porting.ts.deploy2.class.2` properties in the `ts.jte` file. Each Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition implementation must provide an
implementation of the interface `TSDeploymentInterface2` to support the
automatic deployment and undeployment of test applications by the
JavaTest test harness. Providing this functionality enables the entire
test suite to be run without having to manually deploy/undeploy the Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition test applications prior to running the
tests. The implementation provided with this release uses the semantics
of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI.

[[GKLJO]][[ant-based-deployment-interface]]

11.2.2 Ant-Based Deployment Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the Java-based deployment porting interfaces, Java EE 8
CTS introduces an Ant-based porting interface as well. The Java-based
interface is still used for deployment/undeployment during test runs.
The Ant-based interface is used when you want to only deploy/undeploy
archives associated with a subdirectory of tests. The Ant-based
deployment interface is used by the following:

* The `build.special.webservices.clients` target in the
`${ts.home}/bin/build.xml` file +
This target deploys archives to your server implementation and then
builds the client classes that use those archives. You must run this
target before you run the tests under the
`${ts.home}/src/com/sun/ts/tests/webservices12/specialcases` directory.
* The `deploy` and `undeploy` targets in each test subdirectory under
the `${ts.home}/src/com/sun/ts/tests` directory +
To use these targets, which are useful for debugging, you must provide
an Ant-based deployment implementation.

[[GKLJF]][[creating-your-own-ant-based-deployment-implementation]]

11.2.2.1 Creating Your Own Ant-based Deployment Implementation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Ant-based deployment implementation for the Java EE 8 RI is under
`${ts.home}/bin/xml/impl/glassfish` directory. To create your own
implementation, create a `deploy.xml` file under the
`${ts.home}/bin/xml/impl/<vendor-name>` directory. Within the file,
create and implement the -deploy and -undeploy targets.

See `${ts.home}/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/deploy.xml` to see how these
targets are implemented for the Java EE 8 RI .


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

There is also a Java-based implementation of TSDeploymentInterface
(`com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.javaee.glassfish.AutoDeployment`).
This implementation, which leverages the Java EE 8 RI implementation of
the Ant-based deployment interface, calls the Ant targets
programmatically.

=======================================================================


[[GFASI]][[tsjmsadmininterface]]

11.2.3 TSJMSAdminInterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JMS-administered objects are implementation-specific. For this reason,
the creation of connection factories and destination objects have been
set up as part of the porting package. Each Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition implementation must provide an implementation of the
`TSJMSAdminInterface` to support their own connection factory,
topic/queue creation/deletion semantics.

The `TSJMSAdmin` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating concrete
implementations of `TSJMSAdminInterface`. The concrete implementations
are specified by the `porting.ts.jms.class.1` and
`porting.ts.jms.class.2` properties in the `ts.jte` file.

If you wish to create the JMS-administered objects prior to executing
any tests, you may use the default implementation of
`TSJMSAdminInterface`, `SunRIJMSAdmin.java`, which provides a null
implementation. In the case of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI,
the JMS administered objects are created during the execution of the
`config.vi` Ant target.

There are two types of JMS-administered objects:

* A `ConnectionFactory`, which a client uses to create a connection with
a JMS provider
* A `Destination`, which a client uses to specify the destination of
messages it sends and the source of messages it receives

[[GFATH]][[tslogincontextinterface]]

11.2.4 TSLoginContextInterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `TSLoginContext` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating
concrete implementations of `TSLoginContextInterface`. The concrete
implementations are specified by the `porting.ts.login.class.1` property
in the `ts.jte` file. This class is used to enable a program to login as
a specific user, using the semantics of the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI. The certificate necessary for certificate-based login is
retrieved. The keystore file and keystore password from the properties
that are specified in the `ts.jte` file are used.

[[GFATO]][[tsurlinterface]]

11.2.5 TSURLInterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `TSURL` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating concrete
implementations of `TSURLInterface`. The concrete implementations are
specified by the `porting.ts.url.class.1` property in the `ts.jte` file.
Each Java Platform, Enterprise Edition implementation must provide an
implementation of the `TSURLInterface` to support obtaining URL strings
that are used to access a selected Web component. This implementation
can be replaced if a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server
implementation requires URLs to be created in a different manner. In
most Java Platform, Enterprise Edition environments, the default
implementation of this class can be used.

[[GFASJ]][[tshttpsurlconnectioninterface]]

11.2.6 TSHttpsURLConnectionInterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `TSHttpsURLConnection` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating
concrete implementations of `TSHttpsURLConnectionInterface`. The
concrete implementations are specified by the
`porting.ts.HttpsURLConnection.class.1` and `.2` properties in the
`ts.jte` file.

You must provide an implementation of `TSHttpsURLConnectionInterface` to
support the class `HttpsURLConnection`.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `SunRIHttpsURLConnection` implementation class uses
`HttpsURLConnection` from Java SE 8.

=======================================================================


[[GFAUI]][[tsjaxrpcinterface]]

11.2.7 TSJAXRPCInterface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `TSJAXRPC` class acts as a `Factory` object for creating concrete
implementations of `TSJAXRPCInterface`. The concrete implementations are
specified by the `porting.ts.jaxrpc.class.1` and `.2` properties in the
`ts.jte` file.

You must provide an implementation of `TSJAXRPCInterface` to support the
class `TSJAXRPC`. This class is used to provide as name/value pairs the
URL value of the deployed webservice endpoints for those sets of tests
which use DII, direct HTTP, or direct SAAJ to communicate to the
endpoints.
