[NOTE]
========================================================================

The Java Enterprise Edition documentation is part of the Java Enterprise 
Edition contribution to the Eclipse Foundation and is not intended for 
use in relation to Java Enterprise Edition or Java Licensee 
requirements. The documentation is in the process of being revised to 
reflect the new Jakarta EE branding. 
Additional changes will be made as requirements and procedures evolve 
for Jakarta EE. Where applicable, references to Java EE or Java 
Enterprise Edition should be considered references to Jakarta EE. 

Please see the Title page for additional license information.
========================================================================

This book introduces the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) for the Jakarta
Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 (Jakarta EE 8) and Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition 8 Web Profile (Jakarta EE 8 Web Profile), and explains how to
configure and run the test suite. It also provides information for
troubleshooting problems you may encounter as you run the test suite.

The Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 Compatibility Test Suite (Jakarta
EE 8 CTS) is a portable, configurable automated test suite for verifying
the compatibility of a licensee's implementation of the Jakarta EE 8
Specification (hereafter referred to as the licensee implementation).
The Jakarta EE 8 CTS uses the JavaTest harness version 4.4.1 to run the
test suite.
