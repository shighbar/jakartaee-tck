5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The CAJ TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the test
suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"]
respectively.

=======================================================================


[[GBFUZ]][[TCCOA00041]][[starting-javatest]]

5.1 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the CAJ TCK using the JavaTest harness
software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI
* From the command line in your shell environment

[[GBFWH]][[TCCOA00014]][[to-start-javatest-in-gui-mode]]

5.1.1 To Start JavaTest in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant gui
----

[[GBFVW]][[TCCOA00015]][[to-start-javatest-in-command-line-mode]]

5.1.2 To Start JavaTest in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to any subdirectory under `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests`.
2.  Execute the `runclient` target to start the JavaTest run: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant runclient
----
For example, to run the CAJ TCK signature tests, enter the following
commands: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj
ant runclient
----

[[GBFWM]][[TCCOA00042]][[running-a-subset-of-the-tests]]

5.2 Running a Subset of the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run a subset of tests in a GUI and a command-line mode.

[[GBFVT]][[TCCOA00016]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.2.1 To Run a Subset of Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, click Configure, then click Change
Configuration, and then click Tests to Run. +
The tabbed Configuration Editor dialog box is displayed.
2.  Click Specify from the option list on the left.
3.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, and
then click Done. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively,
or select just a single test.
4.  Save the file, and then click Done.
5.  Click Run Tests, and then click Start to run the tests you selected. +
Alternatively, you can right-click the test you want from the test tree
in the left section of the JavaTest main window, and choose Execute
These Tests from the menu.

[[GBFWK]][[TCCOA00017]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.2.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run. +
For example, `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj`.
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant runclient
----
The tests in `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj` and its
subdirectories are run.

[[GBFVL]][[TCCOA00018]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.2.3 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`.

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the CAJ tests with a status of failed and
error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

[[GBFVK]][[TCCOA00043]][[test-reports]]

5.3 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.

[[GBFWD]][[TCCOA00072]][[creating-test-reports]]

5.3.1 Creating Test Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create test reports in a GUI or a command-line mode.

[[GBFVH]][[TCCOA00019]][[to-create-a-test-report-in-gui-mode]]

5.3.1.1 To Create a Test Report in GUI Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, click Report, then click Create Report. +
You are prompted to specify a directory to use for your test reports.
The default location is
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj`.
2.  Specify the directory you want to use for your reports, and then
click OK. +
Use the Filter list to specify whether you want to generate reports for
the current configuration, all tests, or a custom set of tests. +
You are asked whether you want to view the report now.
3.  Click Yes to display the new report in the JavaTest ReportBrowser.

[[GBFVC]][[TCCOA00020]][[to-create-a-test-report-in-command-line-mode]]

5.3.1.2 To Create a Test Report in Command-Line Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specify where you want to create the test report.

1.  To specify the report directory from the command line at runtime,
use: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant -Dreport.dir="report_dir"
----
Reports are written for the last test run to the directory you specify.
The default location is
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/caj`.
2.  To specify the default report directory, set the `report.dir`
property in `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`. +
For example, `report.dir="/home/josephine/reports"`.
3.  To disable reporting, set the `report.dir` property to `"none"`,
either on the command line or in `ts.jte`. +
For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dreport.dir="none"
----

[[GBFVB]][[TCCOA00073]][[viewing-an-existing-test-report]]

5.3.2 Viewing an Existing Test Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can view an existing test report in a GUI and a command-line mode.

[[GBFVO]][[TCCOA00021]][[to-view-an-existing-report-in-gui-mode]]

[[GBFWB]][[TCCOA00022]][[to-view-an-existing-report-in-command-line-mode]]

5.3.2.2 To View an Existing Report in Command-Line Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the Web browser of your choice to view the `report.html` file in the
report directory you specified from the command line or in `ts.jte`.
