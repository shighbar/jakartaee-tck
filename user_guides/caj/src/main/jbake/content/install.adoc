This chapter explains how to install the Common Annotations for the Java
Platform 1.3 (CAJ) 1.3 software.

After installing the software according to the instructions in this
chapter, proceed to link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and
Configuration,"] for instructions on configuring your test environment.

3.1 Obtaining the CAJ 1.3 Reference Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can obtain the CAJ Reference Implementation (RI), Version 1.3
software from the Java Community Process
(`http://jcp.org/en/home/index`) web site. The CAJ RI software is not
necessary for running the CAJ TCK, but it can be useful as a test base
for familiarizing yourself with the TCK before testing your own CAJ
implementation.

3.2 Installing the CAJ Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the CAJ TCK tests, you must install and set up the
following software components:

* Java SE 8 software
* CAJ TCK, Version 1.3 software
* An implementation of the CAJ 1.3 Specification

1.  Install the Java SE 8 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 8 software from the
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html` Web
site. Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software
for additional information.
2.  Install the CAJ TCK 1.3 software.
1.  Copy or download the CAJ TCK software to your local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the CAJ TCK
software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip cajtck-1.3_dd-Mmm-YYYY.zip
----
where dd indicates the day, Mmm indicates the month, and YYYY indicates
the year in which the TCK bundle was created. +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `cajtck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``cajtck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
3.  Install the CAJ implementation to be tested. +
Before testing your own CAJ implementation, it is recommended that you
run the CAJ TCK against the CAJ RI to familiarize yourself with the CAJ
TCK suite and JavaTest software. See link:#GBFUD[Section 3.1, "Obtaining
the CAJ 1.3 Reference Implementation,"] for more information.
