4.1 Configuring Your Environment to Run the JASPIC TCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to configure the JASPIC TCK for your
environment. After configuring your environment, continue with the
instructions in link:#GBFUY[Section 4.4, "Using the JavaTest Harness
Software."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, be sure to use the appropriate
separator for your operating system when specifying multiple path
entries (`;` on Windows, `:` on Solaris/Linux).

=======================================================================


[[GCRWX]][[TCAUT00083]][[deploying-the-jaspic-tck-tests]]

4.1.1 Deploying the JASPIC TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploy the JASPIC TCK tests in the manner that your implementation
requires, based on the type of profile.

If your implementation is Java EE-based, set the `platform.mode`
property in the `ts.jte` file to `javaEE`.

If your implementation is not Java EE-based, set the `platform.mode`
property in the `ts.jte` file to `standalone`.

[[GBFWN]][[TCAUT00012]][[to-configure-your-environment-for-the-jaspic-tck]]

4.1.2 To Configure Your Environment for the JASPIC TCK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes how to configure your environment to run the
JASPIC TCK tests.

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
1.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which the JDK is installed
2.  `PATH` to include the `<TS_HOME>/bin` and <TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin
directories
3.  `ANT_HOME` should not be set in your environment. If it is set,
either unset it or make sure it is set to `<TS_HOME>/tools/ant`.
2.  Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following
properties:
1.  `pathsep` to the type of path separator used by your operating
system +
The default is `:` for Solaris/Linux. Windows users should change this
value to `;`.
2.  Set the `jaspic.home` property to the root directory of
implementation under test.
3.  Set the `orb.host` property to the name of the machine on which you
are running the JASPIC TCK tests.
4.  Set the `orb.port` property to the port number of the machine on
which you are running the JASPIC TCK tests.
5.  Set the `sigTestClasspath` property to point to the implementation
classes that are to be validated for signature compliance. This
classpath must also include any other classes that are referenced,
implemented, or extended by your implementation .
6.  Set the `servlet.is.jsr115.compatible` property based on whether or
not you are running the Servlet profile in a JSR 115–compatible
container.
7.  Set the `soap.is.jsr115.compatible` property based on whether or not
you are running the SOAP profile in a JSR 115–compatible container.
8.  Set the `log.file.location` property to the location where your
implementation's log files and the JASPIC log file will be written.
9.  Set the `logical.hostname.servlet` property to the logical host that
will process Servlet requests. +
Servlet requests may be directed to a logical host using various
physical or virtual host names or addresses. A message processing
runtime may be composed of multiple logical hosts. This setting is
required to properly identify the Servlet profile's application context
identifier hostname. If the logical host that will process Servlet
requests does not exist, you can set this to the default hostname of
your implementation's Web server.
10. Set the `logical.hostname.soap` property to the name of the logical
host that will process SOAP requests. +
This hostname is used in the implementation runtime's application
context identifier in the SOAP profile.
11. Set the `vendor.authconfig.factory` property to specify your
`AuthConfigFactory` class. +
This property setting will be used by the JASPIC tests to register the
test suite's provider in your `AuthConfigFactory`.
3.  Run `ant config.vi`. +
This task configures the implementation under test to run the JASPIC TCK
tests by doing the following:
1.  Copies `jaspic.jar` and `tsharness.jar` to the lib extension
directory (for example, `/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/ext`)
2.  Set up users and passwords for your implementation. +
For the purpose of running the CTS test suite, these should be set as
follows: +
[width="100%",cols="33%,33%,34%",options="header",]
|=========================================
|User |Password |Groups
|`j2ee_vi` |`j2ee_vi` |`staff`
|`javajoe` |`javajoe` |`guest`
|`j2ee` |`j2ee` |`staff`, `mgr`, `asadmin`
|=========================================

Also make sure the principal to role-mappings that are specified in the
runtime XML files are properly mapped in your environment. Note that the
principal-to-role mappings may vary for each application.
3.  Install the client-side certificate in the `trustStore` in your
implementation. +
Certificates are located `<TS_HOME>/bin/certificates`. +
Use the certificate that suits your environment:
* `cts_cert` - For importing the CTS client certificate into a
`truststore`
* `clientcert.jks` - Used by the J2SE runtime to identify the CTS
client's identity
* `clientcert.p12` – Contains CTS client certificate in `pkcs12` format
4.  Append the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/server_policy.append` to the Java
policy file or files on your implementation. +
This file contains the grant statements used by the test harness,
signature tests, and API tests.
5.  Appends the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/client_policy.append` to the
application client's Java policy file, which is referenced in the
`TestExecuteAppClient` section of the `ts.jte` file.
6.  Creates a JVM option that increases the MaxPermSize for your
implementation.
4.  Run `ant enable.jaspic`. +
This task performs the configuration necessary for adding the test
suite's `SPI Verifier(TSSV)` to your implementation. Specifically,
`ant enable.jaspic` performs the following operations:
1.  Sets the `jvm` option `-Dlog.file.location` in your implementation. +
This is the location of the log file where the Test Suite SPI Verifier
(TSSV) creates log messages, which will be used by the JASPIC TCK tests,
to identify the test status.
2.  Sets the `jvm` option `-Dprovider.configuration.file` in your
implementation. +
This option is used to identify the provider configuration file that
will be used by `TSAuthConfigFactory` to load the providers required by
the JASPIC TCK tests.
3.  Sets the `jvm` option
`-Dschema.file.location=${schema.file.location}` in your implementation. +
This option is used to identify the location of the schema file that is
used by the `Provider-Configuration.xml` file.
4.  Sets up your implementation to use the test suite's
`AuthConfigFactory`. +
This can be done in one of the following ways:
* Copy `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.java.security` to the location in your
implementation where the security configuration files reside. For
example, the GlassFish Server security configuration files are in the
`<JAVAEE_HOME>glassfish/domains/domain1/config` directory. After the
file has been copied, use the `-Djava.security.properties` JVM option to
direct your implementation to use this security property file.  For
example, to direct GlassFish Server to use the `ts.java.security` file,
you would use this JVM option: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
-Djava.security.properties=glassfish/domains/domain1/config/ts.java.security
----
* Add the following lines as a single line to the
`JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` file: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
authconfigprovider.factory=
com.sun.ts.tests.jaspic.tssv.config.TSAuthConfigFactory
----
Adding this property to the `java.security` file forces your
implementation to load the test suite's `AuthConfigFactory`.
5.  Copies the `TS_HOME/lib/tssv.jar` file to your implementation
instance library directory. +
The `tssv.jar` file includes the class files necessary to load
`TSAuthConfigFactory` and related classes.
6.  Copies the TSSV configuration files (`ProviderConfiguration.xml`,
`provider-configuration.xsd`) to your implementation instance library
directory.
7.  Deploys the JASPIC file processor,
`com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/util/jaspic_util_web.war`.
5.  If necessary, provide your own implementations of the porting
package interface provided with the JASPIC TCK. +
`TSURLInterface.java` obtains URL strings for web resources in an
implementation-specific manner. API documentation for the
`TSURLInterface.java` porting package interface is available in the
documentation bundle in the `docs/api` directory.

[[CBDBIAGD]][[TCAUT116]][[creating-and-using-a-custom-vehicle]]

4.2 Creating and Using a Custom Vehicle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the JASPIC TCK, vendors can specify the level of JASPIC support
with which they comply. For example, a vendor may be compliant with the
Servlet Profile, the SOAP Profile, or another (possibly unknown)
profile. If a vendor chooses not to pursue compliance with any profile,
they have an option of meeting something called baseline compliance.
This is the level of compliance that exists regardless of which profile
is being tested.

When a vendor is vying for compliance against no profile and is trying
to get baseline compliance certification only, they have to implement a
porting package (for example, a customvehicle) and pass the baseline
tests that are in the `TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/spi/baseline`
directory.

The sections that follow explain how to create a custom vehicle and how
to replace the default vehicle with a custom vehicle.

[[CBDCAIEE]][[TCAUT117]][[to-create-a-custom-vehicle]]

4.2.1 To Create a Custom Vehicle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A custom vehicle must be created and used when JASPIC profile tests are
run in an environment that does not contain a Web server. If your JASPIC
profile implementation includes a Web server, you do not need to
implement your own custom vehicle.

The custom vehicle exists, in stubbed out form, and must be implemented
in a way that provides a wrapper in which JASPIC tests can execute. The
default `jaspicservlet` vehicle is an example of a vehicle that wraps
and executes tests in a Servlet container. The `jaspicservlet` vehicle
source can be used a reference to help you implement your own custom
vehicle. The `jaspicservlet` vehicle is in the
`src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/vehicle/jaspicservlet` directory.

1.  Use the stubbed-out `customvehicle` in the
`src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/vehicle/customvehicle` directory as your
starting point.
2.  Modify the `CustomVehicleRunner` class, using other vehicles as
references. +
The `bin/xml/ts.vehicles.xml` file includes a stubbed-out section for
the `customvehicle`, which you can modify to build you own
`customvehicle`.
3.  Build the `customvehicle` you created.
4.  Modify the `src/vehicle.properties` file so that it refers to
`customvehicle` instead of `jaspicservlet`. +
The `vehicle.properties` file is used during runtime to indicate in
which vehicle the tests should be executed.
5.  Remove or rename the `src/testsuite.jtd` file. +
This allows the test harness to identify tests to be run in your
`customvehicle`.

[[TCAUT118]][[sthref10]]


[[to-replace-the-default-vehicle-with-a-custom-vehicle]]
4.2.2 To Replace the Default Vehicle With a Custom Vehicle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your JASPIC server does not have web support, you will need to create
your own vehicle. A vehicle is a wrapper that supports running tests in
different server-side containers, such as servlet, JSP, and so on. The
JASPIC TCK provides a default vehicle, `jaspicservlet`, which supports
running the TCK tests in a JASPIC runtime that has a Servlet container.
To support running tests in an environment other than a Servlet
container, you need to implement your own vehicle, effectively replacing
the default vehicle, `jaspicservlet`.

This TCK was designed so you could use `jaspicservlet` as a template for
creating your own vehicle. The `jaspicservlet` vehicle is used to
contain and execute your client-side tests in the connector runtime.

The `jaspicservlet` vehicle is located in the
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/vehicle/jaspicservlet` directory.

To run the tests in a vehicle other than `jaspicservlet`, you need to
create a custom vehicle named `customvehicle`. See
link:#CBDCAIEE[Section 4.2.1, "To Create a Custom Vehicle,"] for more
information on this topic.

[[GBFWG]][[TCAUT00044]][[using-the-javatest-harness-configuration-gui]]

4.5 Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the JavaTest harness GUI to modify general test settings and
to quickly get started with the default JASPIC TCK test environment.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It is only necessary to proceed with this section if you want to run the
JavaTest harness in GUI mode. If you plan to run the JavaTest harness in
command-line mode, skip the remainder of this chapter, and continue with
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]

=======================================================================


[[GBFVA]][[TCAUT00084]][[configuration-gui-overview]]

4.5.1 Configuration GUI Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured. The
JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment : This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

The first time you run the JavaTest harness software, you are asked to
specify the test suite and work directory that you want to use. (These
parameters can be changed later from within the JavaTest harness GUI.)

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Run
Tests, and then Start to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness
determines whether all of the required configuration information has
been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview . When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

[[GBFVD]][[TCAUT00085]][[starting-the-configuration-gui]]

4.5.2 Starting the Configuration GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start the JavaTest harness software, you must have a valid
test suite and Java SE 7 installed on your system.

The JASPIC TCK includes an Ant script that is used to execute the
JavaTest harness from the `<TS_HOME>` directory. Using this Ant script
to start the JavaTest harness is part of the procedure described in
link:#GBFVX[Section 4.5.3, "To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the
JASPIC TCK Tests."]

When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the
JavaTest harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through
the initial startup configuration.

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
either opening an existing work directory or creating a new work
directory as described in the JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
opening both a test suite and a work directory as described in the
JavaTest documentation.

After you specify a work directory, you can use the Test Manager to
configure and run tests as described in link:#GBFVX[Section 4.5.3, "To
Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the JASPIC TCK Tests."]

[[GBFVX]][[TCAUT00086]][[to-configure-the-javatest-harness-to-run-the-jaspic-tck-tests]]

4.5.3 To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the JASPIC TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions
are specific to your site. For example, the name of the host on which
the JavaTest harness is running. Other configuration parameters can be
set however you wish. For example, where you want test report files to
be stored.

Note that you only need to complete all these steps the first time you
start the JavaTest test harness. After you complete these steps, you can
either run all of the tests by completing the steps in
link:using.html#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting JavaTest,"] or run a subset
of the tests by completing the steps in link:using.html#GBFWM[Section
5.2, "Running a Subset of the Tests."]

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and start the JavaTest test
harness: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant gui
----
If the Welcome screen does not appear do the following, otherwise skip
to the next step.
2.  From the File menu, select Open Quick Start Wizard. +
The Welcome screen displays.
3.  Select Start a new test run, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to create a new configuration or use a configuration
template.
4.  Select Create a new configuration, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to select a test suite.
5.  Accept the default suite (`<TS_HOME>/src`), and then click Next. +
You are prompted to specify a work directory to use to store your test
results.
6.  Type a work directory name or use the Browse button to select a work
directory, and then click Next. +
You are prompted to start the configuration editor or start a test run.
At this point, the JASPIC TCK is configured to run the default test
suite.
7.  Deselect the Start the configuration editor option, and then click
Finish.
8.  Click Run Tests, then click Start. +
The JavaTest harness starts running the tests.
9.  To reconfigure the JavaTest test harness, do one of the following:
* Click Configuration, then click New Configuration.
* Click Configuration, then click Change Configuration.
10. Click Report, and then click Create Report.
11. Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
12. Click Yes to view the report.

[[GBFUU]][[TCAUT00087]][[modifying-the-default-test-configuration]]

4.5.4 Modifying the Default Test Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest GUI enables you to configure numerous test options. These
options are divided into two general dialog box groups:

* Group 1: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change Configuration
submenus, the following options are displayed in a tabbed dialog box:

** Tests to Run

** Exclude List

** Keywords

** Prior Status

** Test Environment

** Concurrency

** Timeout Factor
* Group 2: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change
Configuration/Other Values submenu, or by pressing Ctrl+E, the following
options are displayed in a paged dialog box:

** Environment Files

** Test Environment

** Specify Tests to Run

** Specify an Exclude List

Note that there is some overlap between the functions in these two
dialog boxes; for those functions use the dialog box that is most
convenient for you. Please refer to the JavaTest Harness documentation
or the online help for complete information about these various options.
