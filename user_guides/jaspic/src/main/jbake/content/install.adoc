3.2 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java Authentication SPI for Containers TCK tests,
you need to install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 7
* Java Authentication SPI for Containers (JASPIC) 1.1 Vendor
Implementation (VI)
* Java Authentication SPI for Containers TCK Version 1.1

1.  Install the Java SE 7 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 7 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JASPIC 1.1 configuration that is to
be tested. To familiarize yourself with theJava Authentication SPI for
Containers TCK suite and the JavaTest software before you begin testing
with your own implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using
the Java EE 7 RI.
3.  Install the JASPIC TCK 1.1 software.
1.  Copy or download the JASPIC TCK software to your local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the JASPIC TCK
software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jaspictck-1.1_date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the JASPIC TCK bundle name could be
`jaspictck-1.1_15-May-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `jaspictck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``jaspictck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
