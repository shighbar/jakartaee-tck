Alternatively, you can right-click the test you want from the test tree
in the left pane of the JavaTest main window, and choose Execute These
Tests from the popup menu.
6.  Click Report, and then click Create Report.
7.  Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
8.  Click Yes to view the report.

[[GBFWK]][[TCAUT00018]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.2.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run. +
For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/jaspic/spi/servlet
----
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant runclient
----
Tests in
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/jaspic/spi/servlet` and
its subdirectories are run.

[[GBFVL]][[TCAUT00019]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.2.3 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`.

1.  Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property. +
The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:
* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun` +
For example, you could run the JASPIC signature test with a status of
failed and error by invoking the following commands: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/jaspic/spi/servlet
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----
Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

[[GEQMG]][[TCAUT00047]][[running-profile-specific-tests]]

5.3 Running Profile-Specific Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A JASPIC implementation can implement one or more of the profiles
specified in the specification. To accommodate this, the JASPIC TCK
tests use the JavaTest `keyword` feature, which enables vendors to run
tests that are relevant to their implementation.

For example, a vendor who implements only a `servlet` profile can run
all tests specific to the `servlet` profile.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dkeywords="jaspic_core | jaspic_servlet" runclient 
----

As another example, for running tests relevant to a `soap` profile, you
could use the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dkeywords="jaspic_core | jaspic_soap" runclient 
----

The keywords that can be used are:

* `jaspic_core`
* `jaspic_servlet`
* `jaspic_soap`

[[GBWKD]][[TCAUT00048]][[building-and-running-the-jaspic-tck-tests-using-ant]]

5.4 Building and Running the JASPIC TCK Tests Using Ant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Ant to build and run the test suite.

2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/install/jaspic` directory and run ant to
create and set up your `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory if it has not yet been
set up.
3.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and edit the `ts.jte` file
to set the required properties needed for using the Ant build
environment.
1.  `jaspic.home` to the directory in which you installed the JASPIC RI
(typically the Java EE 7 RI directory)
2.  `orb.host` to the name of the machine on which you are running the
JASPIC TCK tests

[[GBWJZ]][[TCAUT00022]][[to-run-the-tests]]

5.4.2 To Run the Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  To run a single test directory, type the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/spi/servlet
ant runclient
----
This runs all tests in the `spi/servlet` test directory.
2.  To run a single test within a test directory, type: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/spi/servlet
ant runclient -Dtest=AuthConfigFactoryGetFactory 
----
This runs only the `AuthConfigFactoryGetFactory` test in the
`spi/servlet` test directory. You select the test name to run by looking
at the `testName` tags in the `Client.java` file.
3.  To run a subset of test directories type: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/spi/servlet
ant runclient

[[GBFVK]][[TCAUT00049]][[test-reports]]

5.5 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the Web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.
