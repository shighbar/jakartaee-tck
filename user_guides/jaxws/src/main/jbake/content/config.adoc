4 Setup and Configuration
-------------------------

This chapter describes how to set up the JAX-WS TCK and JavaTest harness
software. Before proceeding with the instructions in this chapter, be
sure to install all required software, as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation"].


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The JAX-WS TCK 2.3 contains two configuration values in
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` that correspond to the two implementations used
during test execution. These two properties are `jaxws.home` and
`jaxws.home.ri`.

The `jaxws.home` property should point to the implementation under test.
In most cases, this will be your implementation of JAX-WS. However, it
is recommended that you initially set this to the location of the JAX-WS
RI to familiarize yourself with the JAX-WS TCK suite and JavaTest
software, as well as ensure that your environment is correctly
configured.

The `jaxws.home.ri` property must always be set to the location of the
Reference Implementation. The installation to which `jaxws.home.ri`
points to is used when running reverse tests. These tests can only be
run after you have successfully rebuilt the tests using your
implementation of the JAX-WS 2.3 toolset. Please see
link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Rebuilding the JAX-WS TCK Using the
Vendor's Toolset"] for more information on rebuilding tests.

4.1 Configuring Your Environment to Run the JAX-WS TCK Against the JAX-WS Reference Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring your environment as described in this section,
continue with the instructions in link:#GBFUY[Using the JavaTest Harness
Software].


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows XP/Vista. In addition, the
forward slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced
with backslashes (`\`) for Windows XP/Vista. Finally, be sure to use the
appropriate separator for your operating system when specifying multiple
path entries (`;` on Windows, `:` on UNIX/Linux).

On Windows, you must escape any backslashes with an extra backslash in
path separators used in any of the following properties, or use forward
slashes as a path separator instead. For example, if the Java EE 8 RI
installation is `C:\JavaEE8`, you must specify it as `C:\\JavaEE8` or
`C:/JavaEE8`.

=======================================================================


1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
1.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE is installed
2.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the JAX-WS TCK 2.3 software is
installed
3.  `ANT_HOME` should not be set in your environment. If it is set,
unset it.
2.  Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following
environment variables:
1.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the hostname where the web
server is running that is configured with the JAX-WS RI. +
The default setting is `localhost`.
2.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number where the web
server is running that is configured with the JAX-WS RI. +
The default setting is `8000`.
3.  Set the `jaxws.home` property to the location where the JAX-WS RI is
installed. +
The default setting is `${webcontainer.home}`. The value of this
property must match the value of the `webcontainer.home` property that
is set in step link:#BABBJEDF[g].
4.  Set the `jaxws.classes` property to point to the JAX-WS RI
classes/jars. +
Note that this property is already set and should not require any
changes.
5.  Verify that the `tools.jar` property is set to the location of the
`tools.jar` file that is distributed with Java SE.
6.  Set the
`impl.vi, impl.vi.deploy.dir, impl.vi.host, and impl.vi.port` properties
to the supported web container, deploy directory, host and port for the
JAX-WS RI. +
The supported web container for the JAX-WS RI is the Java EE 8 RI. So
the default settings for these properties are as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
impl.vi.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home}/domains/domain1/autodeploy
impl.vi=glassfish.xml
impl.vi.host=${webServerHost}
impl.vi.port=${webServerPort}
----
7.  [[BABBJEDF]] +
Set the `webcontainer.home` property to the location where the web
server is installed for the JAX-WS RI. This will be where the Java EE 8
RI is installed.
8.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class.1` property to the porting
implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. +
The default setting for the JAX-WS RI porting implementation is: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.common.SunRIURL
----
9.  Set the `user` and `password` properties to the user name and
password used for the basic authentication tests. +
The default setting is `j2ee` for both.
10. Set the `authuser` and `authpassword` properties to the user name
and password used for the basic authentication tests. +
The default setting for both is `javajoe`.
11. Set the `http.server.supports.endpoint.publish` property based on
whether Endpoint Publish APIs are supported on the container.
12. If using Java SE 8 or above, verify that the property
`endorsed.dirs` is set to the location of the VI API jars for those
technologies you wish to override. Java SE 8 contains an implementation
of JAX-WS 2.2 which will conflict with JAX-WS 2.3, therefore this
property must be set so that JAX-WS 2.3 will be used during the building
of tests and during test execution.
3.  Edit the catalog file
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/common/xml/catalog /META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml`,
replacing the host and port settings of `systemId` with the value of
your host and port setting where the WSDL is published.

4.  Set the `jaxws.classes` property to point to the Vendor
Implementation classes/JAR files. +
As an example, the `ts.jte` file contains the property
`jaxws.classes.ri`, which contains the classes/jar files that the Java
EE 8 RI uses. The `jaxws.classes.ri` settings for the Java EE 8 RI web
container are as follows: +

${jaxws.lib.ri}/gmbal.jar:
${jaxws.lib.ri}/management-api.jar:
${jaxws.lib.ri}/mimepull.jar
----
The `jaxws.classes.ri` settings if using the Apache Tomcat web container
with the Standalone JAX-WS 2.3 RI would be as follows: +

----
5.  Verify that the `tools.jar` property is set to the location of the
`tools.jar` file that is distributed with Java SE.
6.  Set the `impl.vi`, `impl.vi.deploy.dir`, `impl.vi.host`, and
`impl.vi.port` properties to the supported web container, deploy
directory, host and port for the Vendor Implementation. +
As an example, the `ts.jte` file contains the settings for the Java EE 8
RI, which are as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
webcontainer.home.ri=/sun/javaee6
impl.ri.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home.ri}/domains/domain1/autodeploy
impl.ri=glassfish.xml
impl.ri.host=${webServerHost.2}
impl.ri.port=${webServerPort.2}
----
The RI settings using the Apache Tomcat web container with the
Standalone JAX-WS 2.3 RI would be as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
webcontainer.home.ri=/tomcat
impl.ri=tomcat
impl.ri.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home.ri}/webapps
impl.ri.host=${webServerHost.2}
impl.ri.port=${webServerPort.2}
----
7.  [[BABDJAHI]] +
Set the `webcontainer.home` property to the location where the web
container for the Vendor Implementation is installed.
8.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class.1` property to the porting
implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. +
The default setting for the JAX-WS RI porting implementation is: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.common.SunRIURL
----
9.  Set the `user` and `password` properties to the user name and
password used for the basic authentication tests. +
The default setting for both is `j2ee`.
10. Set the `authuser` and `authpassword` properties to the user name
and password used for the basic authentication tests. +
The default setting for both is `javajoe`.
11. Set the `http.server.supports.endpoint.publish` property based on
whether Endpoint Publish APIs are supported on the container.
12. If using Java SE 8 or above, verify that the property
`endorsed.dirs` is set to the location of the RI API jars for those
technologies you wish to override. Java SE 8 contains an implementation
of JAX-WS 2.2 which will conflict with JAX-WS 2.3, therefore this
property must be set so that JAX-WS 2.3 will be used during the building
of tests and during test execution.
3.  Edit the catalog file
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/common/xml/catalog /META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml`,
replacing the host and port settings of `systemId` with the value of
your host and port setting where the WSDL is published.
4.  Provide your own implementation of the porting package interface
provided with the JAX-WS TCK. +
The porting package interface, `TSURLInterface.java`, obtains URL
strings for web resources in an implementation-specific manner. API
documentation for the `TSURLInterface.java` porting package interface is
available in the JAX-WS TCK documentation bundle. +
The `<TS_HOME>/bin/jaxws-url-props.dat` file contains the webservice
endpoint and WSDL URLs that the TCK tests use when running against the
JAX-WS RI. In the porting package that the TCK uses, the URLs are
returned as is since this is the form that the JAX-WS RI expects. You
may need an alternate form of these URLs in order to run the TCK tests
in your environment. However, you MUST NOT modify the
`jaxws-url-props.dat` file, but instead make any necessary changes in
your own porting implementation class to transform the URLs
appropriately for your environment.

that is set in step link:#BABCAAFJ[n].
8.  The `jaxws.classes.ri` property is already configured to point to
the JAX-WS RI classes/JAR files. +
No changes are necessary for this property.
9.  Set the `wsgen.ant.classname` property to the Vendor Implementation
class that mimics the JAX-WS RI Ant task, which in turn calls the
`wsgen` Java-to-WSDL tool.
10. Set the `wsimport.ant.classname` property to the Vendor
Implementation class that mimics the JAX-WS RI Ant task, which in turn
calls the `wsimport` WSDL-to-Java tool.
11. Set the `impl.vi`, `impl.vi.deploy.dir`, `impl.vi.host`, and
`impl.vi.port` properties to the supported web container, deploy
directory, host and port used for the Vendor Implementation.
12. Set the `impl.ri`, `impl.ri.deploy.dir`, `impl.ri.host`, and
`impl.ri.port` properties to the supported web container, deploy

`endorsed.dirs` is set to the location of the VI API jars for those
technologies you wish to override. Java SE 8 contains an implementation
of JAX-WS 2.2 which will conflict with JAX-WS 2.3, therefore this
property must be set so that JAX-WS 2.3 will be used during the building
of tests and during test execution.

4.4 Configuring Your Environment to Simultaneously Run the JAX-WS TCK Against the VI and the JAX-WS RI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the steps needed to configure the JAX-WS TCK so
that all tests can be run; forward tests against the Vendor
Implementation and reverse tests against the JAX-WS Reference
Implementation.

Since the JAX-WS TCK needs to be tested against both the JAX-WS
Reference Implementation and the Vendor Implementation, two separate Web
servers need to be configured. Two individual Web servers are required,
and the same steps, below, must be performed to configure each Web
server.

If you are not going to perform this kind of testing at this time, skip
this section and proceed to link:#GCFOI[Configuring and Starting Your
Application Server or Servers], otherwise perform the steps described in
the following sections:

* link:#GCLHU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the JAX-WS TCK Against
the Vendor Implementation]
* link:#GCLHF[Configuring Your Environment to Rebuild and Run the JAX-WS
TCK Against the JAX-WS RI]

[[GCFOI]][[TCJWS00061]][[configuring-and-starting-your-application-server-or-servers]]

4.5 Configuring and Starting Your Application Server or Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the following two procedures to configure your application
server environments for the RI and VI.

4.6 Deploying the JAX-WS TCK Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JAX-WS TCK provides an automatic way of deploying both the prebuilt
and Vendor-built archives to the configured web container or container
by using deployment handlers.

The handler file (`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/deploy.xml`) is
written to be used with the Java EE 8 RI. If the Vendor chooses not to
use Java EE 8 RI with their implementation, or chooses to rebuild the
JAX-WS TCK tests using some other method than the infrastructure
provided, they should create their own version handler file to provide
this functionality.

This section describes the various commands used for deploying the WAR
files to the configured web container.

* link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios]
* link:#GCLIW[Deploying the JAX-WS TCK Prebuilt Archives]
* link:#GCLIL[Deploying the Rebuilt JAX-WS TCK Tests Against the JAX-WS
Reference Implementation]

[[GCLJG]][[TCJWS00101]][[generic-deployment-command-scenarios]]

4.6.1 Generic Deployment Command Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `keywords` system property enables you to deploy a subset of the
tests that would normally be deployed in batch mode by means of
`<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant deploy`. To specify it, add the option
`-Dkeywords=`value to the `ant` command, where value is either
`forward`, `reverse`, or `all`. The supported values control the
directions in which the rebuildable tests are deployed.

* Setting this property to `all` (the default) deploys both the prebuilt
and Vendor build tests.
* Setting the property to `forward` deploys the prebuilt tests in the
forward direction only.
* Setting the property to `reverse` deploys the Vendor rebuilt tests in
the reverse direction only.

4.6.2 Deploying the JAX-WS TCK Prebuilt Archives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section explains issues regarding the deployment of the JAX-WS TCK
prebuilt archives. Before conducting any deployment, ensure that your
environment has been configured by following the instructions in either
the link:#GBFVU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the JAX-WS TCK
Against the JAX-WS Reference Implementation] or the
link:#GCLHU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the JAX-WS TCK Against
the Vendor Implementation] sections.

The `<TS_HOME>/dist` directory contains all the WAR files for the JAX-WS
TCK web service endpoint tests that have been compiled and generated
using the JAX-WS Reference Implementation and packaged for deployment on
a Servlet-compliant web container using the standard Web Archive (WAR)
format.

These WAR files contain only portable artifacts for all the TCK web
service endpoint tests, and are tailored to run against the JAX-WS
Reference Implementation via the `web.xml` file in addition to a runtime
file, `sun-jaxws.xml`. These WAR files allow you to deploy (without any
additional setup or modification) against the JAX-WS Reference
Implementation to test the various features and functionality of this
implementation.

A Vendor is required to deploy the prebuilt WAR files as is on their
JAX-WS implementation without any changes to the WAR archives with the
exception of replacing and/or removing only the `web.xml` and the
`sun-jaxws.xml` files.

To deploy the tests, the Vendor should perform a deployment using either
the `deploy` or `deployall` batch command as described in
link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios], and specify the
`-Dkeywords=forward` option.

4.6.3 Deploying the Rebuilt JAX-WS TCK Tests Against the JAX-WS
Reference Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes how to deploy the Vendor rebuilt JAX-WS TCK tests
against the Vendor Implementation. Before conducting the deployment,
ensure that you have followed the instructions in
link:#GBFVU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the JAX-WS TCK Against
the JAX-WS Reference Implementation].

This deployment scenario assumes that the Vendor has rebuilt all the
JAX-WS TCK tests using the existing infrastructure, and that the WAR
files exist alongside the prebuilt war files in the `<TS_HOME>/dist`
directory. The rebuilt WAR files will be prepended with the text
`vi_built_`.

If the Vendor chooses some other method of rebuilding the tests, they
may still be able to use this deployment method as long as the WAR files
are built correctly and are prepended with the text `vi_built_`. Refer
to the link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Rebuilding the JAX-WS TCK
Using the Vendor's Toolset"] to learn about rebuilding the JAX-WS TCK
tests.

To deploy the tests, the Vendor should perform a deployment using either
the `deploy` or `deployall` batch command, as described in
link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios], and specify the
`-Dkeywords=reverse` option

4.7 Using the JavaTest Harness Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the JAX-WS TCK test suite using the
JavaTest harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI; if using this method, please continue on to
link:#GBFWG[Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI].
* In JavaTest batch mode, from the command line in your shell
environment; if using this method, please proceed directly to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests"].

[[GBFWG]][[TCJWS00064]][[using-the-javatest-harness-configuration-gui]]

4.8 Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the JavaTest harness GUI to modify general test settings and
to quickly get started with the default JAX-WS TCK test environment.
This section covers the following topics:

* link:#GBFVA[Configuration GUI Overview]
* link:#GBFVD[Starting the Configuration GUI]
* link:#GBFVX[Configuring the JavaTest Harness to Run the JAX-WS TCK
Tests]
* link:#GBFUU[Modifying the Default Test Configuration]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It is only necessary to proceed with this section if you want to run the
JavaTest harness in GUI mode. If you plan to run the JavaTest harness in
command-line mode, skip the remainder of this chapter, and continue with
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests"].

=======================================================================


[[GBFVA]][[TCJWS00104]][[configuration-gui-overview]]

4.8.1 Configuration GUI Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured. The
JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment: This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

The first time you run the JavaTest harness software, you are asked to
specify the test suite and work directory that you want to use. (These
parameters can be changed later from within the JavaTest harness GUI.)

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Run
Tests, then Start to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness determines
whether all of the required configuration information has been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview . When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

[[GBFVD]][[TCJWS00105]][[starting-the-configuration-gui]]

4.8.2 Starting the Configuration GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start the JavaTest harness software, you must have a valid
test suite and Java SE installed on your system.

The JAX-WS TCK includes an Ant script that is used to execute the
JavaTest harness from the `<TS_HOME>` directory. Using this Ant script
to start the JavaTest harness is part of the procedure described in
link:#GBFVX[Configuring the JavaTest Harness to Run the JAX-WS TCK
Tests].

When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the
JavaTest harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through
the initial startup configuration.

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
either opening an existing work directory or creating a new work
directory as described in the JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
opening both a test suite and a work directory as described in the
JavaTest documentation.

After you specify a work directory, you can use the Test Manager to
configure and run tests as described in link:#GBFVX[Configuring the
JavaTest Harness to Run the JAX-WS TCK Tests].

[[GBFVX]][[TCJWS00106]][[configuring-the-javatest-harness-to-run-the-jax-ws-tck-tests]]

4.8.3 Configuring the JavaTest Harness to Run the JAX-WS TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions
are specific to your site. For example, the name of the host on which
the JavaTest harness is running. Other configuration parameters can be
set however you wish. For example, where you want test report files to
be stored.

Note that you only need to complete all these steps the first time you
start the JavaTest test harness. After you complete these steps, you can
either run all of the tests by completing the steps in
link:using.html#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest] or run a subset of the tests by
completing the steps in link:using.html#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the
Tests].

[[GBFUU]][[TCJWS00107]][[modifying-the-default-test-configuration]]

4.8.4 Modifying the Default Test Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest GUI enables you to configure numerous test options. These
options are divided into two general dialog box groups:

* Group 1: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change Configuration
submenus, the following options are displayed in a tabbed dialog box:

** Tests to Run

** Exclude List

** Keywords

** Prior Status

** Test Environment

** Concurrency

** Timeout Factor
* Group 2: Available from the JavaTest Configure/Change
Configuration/Other Values submenu, or by pressing Ctrl+E, the following
options are displayed in a paged dialog box:

** Environment Files

** Test Environment

** Specify Tests to Run

** Specify an Exclude List

Note that there is some overlap between the functions in these two
dialog boxes; for those functions use the dialog box that is most
convenient for you. Please refer to the JavaTest Harness documentation
or the online help for complete information about these various options.
