5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JAX-WS TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the
test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration"],
respectively.

[[GCLRI]][[TCJWS00065]][[overview]]

5.1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained in link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Rebuilding the
JAX-WS TCK Using the Vendor's Toolset"], the JAX-WS TCK introduces the
concept of rebuilding the TCK tests. To provide the user an ability to
run the TCK against the Vendor Implementation and the Reference
Implementation, the use of the `keywords` feature (in GUI mode) or
option `-Dkeywords=`value (in command line mode) is provided.

By default, the TCK is configured to run all tests in both directions
for all the tests except the signature tests. Setting `keywords` allows
the user to change which tests will be run.

* Setting the `keywords` property to `all` (the default) does not filter
out any tests, and results in the prebuilt tests to be run in the
forward direction, and the Vendor rebuilt tests to be run in the reverse
direction.
* Setting `keywords` to `forward` causes the prebuilt tests to be run in
the forward direction only.
* Setting `keywords` to `reverse` causes the Vendor rebuilt tests to be
run in the reverse direction only.

Refer to the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the documentation
bundle for information regarding how to configure the `keywords` feature
in GUI mode. For command line mode, add the following to your command
line `-Dkeywords=``value`, where value is either `forward`, `reverse`,
or `all`.

[[GBFUZ]][[TCJWS00066]][[starting-javatest]]

5.2 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the JAX-WS TCK using the JavaTest
harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI
* From the command line in your shell environment

[[GBFWH]][[TCJWS00028]][[to-start-javatest-in-gui-mode]]

5.2.1 To Start JavaTest in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Execute the following commands: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin

2.  Configure the `keywords` feature within the JavaTest GUI. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Refer to the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the documentation
bundle for information regarding how to configure the `keywords` feature
in GUI mode.

=======================================================================


[[GBFVW]][[TCJWS00029]][[to-start-javatest-in-command-line-mode]]

5.2.2 To Start JavaTest in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to any subdirectory under `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests`.
2.  Start JavaTest using the following command: +

----
::

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `-Dkeywords` option is supported by the `runclient` command in batch
mode only, not in GUI mode.

=======================================================================


[[TCJWS00012]][[GCMCU]]


Example 5-1 Running JAX-WS TCK Signature Tests

To run the JAX-WS TCK signature tests, enter the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/jaxws
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant [-Dkeywords=forward|reverse|all] runclient 
----

[[TCJWS00013]][[GCMBV]]


Example 5-2 Running a Single Test Directory

To run a single test directory in the `forward` direction, enter the
following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/api/javax_xml_ws/Dispatch 
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant -Dkeywords=forward runclient
----

[[TCJWS00014]][[GCMCA]]

the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/api 
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant -Dkeywords=reverse runclient
----

[[GBFWM]][[TCJWS00067]][[running-a-subset-of-the-tests]]

5.3 Running a Subset of the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run a subset of the tests:

* link:#GBFVT[Section 5.3.1, "To Run a Subset of Tests in GUI Mode"]
* link:#GBFWK[Section 5.3.2, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line
Mode"]
* link:#GBFVL[Section 5.3.3, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode
Based on Prior Result Status"]

[[GBFVT]][[TCJWS00030]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.3.1 To Run a Subset of Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, click Configure, then click Change
Configuration, and then click Tests to Run. +
The tabbed Configuration Editor dialog box is displayed.
2.  Click Specify from the option list on the left.
3.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, and
then click Done. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively,
or select just a single test.
4.  Click Save File.
5.  Click Run Tests, and then click Start to run the tests you selected. +
Alternatively, you can right-click the test you want from the test tree
in the left section of the JavaTest main window, and choose Execute
These Tests from the menu.
6.  Click Report, and then click Create Report.
7.  Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
8.  Click Yes to view the report.

[[GBFWK]][[TCJWS00031]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.3.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run. +
For example, `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/api`.
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant [-Dkeywords=forward|reverse|all] runclient 
----
The tests in `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/api` and its
subdirectories are run in the direction or directions that you specified
with the `keywords` option.

[[GBFVL]][[TCJWS00032]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.3.3 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant`.

Invoke `<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the JAX-WS tests with a status of failed
and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws
<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin/ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" \
[-Dkeywords=forward|reverse|all] runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

if desired, link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests].

[[GBFVK]][[TCJWS00072]][[test-reports]]

5.8 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.
