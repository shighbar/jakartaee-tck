3.2 Installing the Java Transaction API TCK Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java Transaction API TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* JDK 8.0
* JTA TCK version 1.3, which includes Apache Ant 1.9.7
* The JTA implementation to be tested. If you are running against
Oracle's JTA Reference Implementation, install Oracle's Java EE 8
Reference Implementation; if not, install your JTA Vendor Implementation
(VI).

1.  Install the JDK 8.0 software, if it is
not already installed. +
Download and install the JDK 8.0 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the JTA TCK 1.3 software.
1.  Copy or download the JTA TCK software to your local system. +
2.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jtatck-1.3_date.zip
----
This creates the `jtatck` directory. The install-dir/jtatck directory is
the test suite home, install-dir.
3.  Install the JTA 1.3 Reference Implementation. +
JTA 1.3 Reference Implementation is used to validate your initial
configuration and setup of the JTA TCK 1.3 tests, which are explained
further in link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration."]
4.  Install your JTA Vendor Implementation (VI) to be tested. +
Follow the installation instructions for the particular VI under test.
