5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JSON-P TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the
test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting JavaTest"]
* link:#BCGGIADH[Section 5.2, "Running All of the JSON-P TCK Tests"]
* link:#GBFWM[Section 5.3, "Running a Subset of the Tests"]
* link:#GBFVK[Section 5.5, "Test Reports"]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration"],
respectively.

=======================================================================

5.2 Running All of the JSON-P TCK Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run the JSON-P TCK tests:

* link:#BCGGCGEA[Section 5.2.1, "To Run All of the JSON-P TCK Tests in
GUI Mode"]
* link:#BCGEAAHD[Section 5.2.2, "To Run All of the JSON-P TCK Tests in
Command-Line Mode"]

[[BCGGCGEA]][[to-run-all-of-the-json-p-tck-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.2.1 To Run All of the JSON-P TCK Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In GUI mode, the JSON-P TCK tests must be run as a 2-step process. The
pluggability tests require a reconfiguration to plug in the
`JsonProvider` class that is supplied with the test suite. This class is
used by the tests to verify the SPI layer.

Run all of the JSON-P TCK tests except the pluggability tests:

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and start the JavaTest test
harness: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant gui
----
The Welcome screen displays.
2.  Select Start a new test run, then select Next.
3.  Enter the test suite (for example, `<TS_HOME>/src` ), then select
Next.
4.  Select Create a new configuration, then select Next.
5.  Enter the work directory (for example, `/tmp/JTwork`), then select
Next.
6.  Select Configure, then select Start the configuration editor, then
select Finish. +
The Configuration Welcome screen displays.
7.  Select Next. +
You are prompted to specify one or more configuration files that contain
information about your test environment. By default, this file is
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`.
8.  Accept the default configuration file and select Next. +
You are prompted to specify a test environment.
9.  Select either ts_unix or ts_win32, then select Next. +
Select ts_unix if you are running the tests in a Unix or Linux
environment; select ts_win32 if you are running the tests in a Windows
environment. +
After making your selection and selecting Next, you are prompted to
specify whether you want to run all or a subset of the test suite.
10. Specify whether you want to run all or a subset of the tests, then
select Next. +
Select Yes to run a subset of the tests; select No to run all tests. +
Since the pluggability tests must be run separately from the other
tests, select Yes.
11. Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, then
select Next. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively.
Select all tests except pluggability tests by unchecking the
pluggability tests.
12. Specify whether you want to use an exclude list, then select Next. +
Select Yes to use an exclude list; select No to not use an exclude list. +
If you select Yes, proceed to the next step. If you select No, skip to
Step 15.
13. Specify the exclude list you want to use, then select Next. +
Select initial to use the default list; select custom to use a custom
list. +
If you select custom, proceed to the next step. If you select initial,
skip to Step 14.
14. Specify one or more exclude list files to use, then select Next.
15. Select Done to accept and save your configuration settings. +
You are prompted to specify the location in which you want to save your
configuration settings.
16. Specify the file in which you want to save your configuration
settings, then select Save File. +
You are returned to the JavaTest main window.
17. If you want to run the test suite at this time using your current
configuration settings, select Run Tests, then select Start from the
main menu. +
The tests in the `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonp` and
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/jsonp` directory are
executed. The pluggability tests, which require additional
configuration, will not be run.

Run the pluggability tests, which require a separate test run:

1.  Exit the JavaTest GUI.
2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and reconfigure environment
to use the `JsonProvider` class that is supplied with the test suite and
restart the JavaTest GUI: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant enable.alternate.jsonp.provider
ant/bin/ant gui
----
3.  Select Configure, then select Edit Configuration.
4.  Select Tests to Run.

[[GBFVL]][[TCCOA00018]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.3.4 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`.

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the JSON-P tests with a status of failed
and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonp
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

5.4 Running the Pluggability Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run the pluggability tests:

* link:#BCGFHIDI[Section 5.4.1, "To Run the Pluggability Tests in GUI
Mode"]
* link:#BCGEGBGE[Section 5.4.2, "To Run the Pluggability Tests in
Command-Line Mode"]

[[BCGFHIDI]][[to-run-the-pluggability-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.4.1 To Run the Pluggability Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  If the JavaTest GUI is running, exit the GUI.
2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and reconfigure environment
to use the `JsonProvider` class that is supplied with the test suite and
restart the JavaTest GUI: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant enable.alternate.jsonp.provider
ant gui
----
3.  Select Configure, then select Edit Configuration.
4.  Select Tests to Run.
5.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, then
select Next. +
Select the pluggability tests only by unchecking all of the other tests.
6.  Select Done.
7.  Select Run Tests, then select Start.
8.  Exit the JavaTest GUI when finished.
9.  Disable the alternate JSON provider that you enabled in Step 2,
before you initiated the test run for the pluggability tests: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant disable.alternate.jsonp.provider
----

[[BCGEGBGE]][[to-run-the-pluggability-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.4.2 To Run the Pluggability Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to run the pluggability tests from the command line.
It is highly recommended to use the first method, since it automatically
calls the Ant targets to enable and disable the test provider. If you
choose to use the second method, you will need to execute those Ant
targets manually before and after you run the tests.

The first method is by executing the `run.pluggability` target in Ant:

1.  Execute the `run.pluggability` target using Ant: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant run.pluggability
----
The `run.pluggability` target calls Ant targets that enable the test
provider, run the pluggability tests, then disable the test provider.

The pluggability tests can also be run an alternate way, albeit one that
requires more manual intervention:

1.  Execute the `enable.alternate.jsonp.provider` target using Ant: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant enable.alternate.jsonp.provider
----
The `enable.alternate.jsonp.provider` target enables the alternate test
provider.
2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonp/pluggability>`
directory: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonp/pluggability>
----
3.  Start the pluggability test run by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant runclient
----
This will run just the pluggability tests under the
<`TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jsonp/pluggability` directory, using a
test-supplied `JsonProvider Class` for testing the SPI. All
`JsonProvider` method calls will be invoked and verified by the tests to
ensure SPI layer is working.
4.  Execute the `disable.alternate.jsonp.provider` target using Ant: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant disable.alternate.jsonp.provider
----
The `disable.alternate.jsonp.provider` target disables the alternate
test provider.

[[GBFVK]][[TCCOA00043]][[test-reports]]

5.5 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.
