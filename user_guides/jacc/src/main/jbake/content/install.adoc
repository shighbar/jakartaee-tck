3.2 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the JACC TCK tests, you must install and set up the
following software components:

* Java SE 7
* JACC TCK version 1.5, which includes Apache Ant 1.7.0
* The JACC implementation to be tested +
If you are running against the JACC 1.5 Reference Implementation,
install the Java EE 7 RI software; if not, install your JACC Vendor
Implementation (VI).

1.  Install the Java SE 7 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 7 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the JACC TCK 1.5 software.
1.  Copy or download the JACC TCK software to your local system.
2.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle in the directory of
your choice: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jacctck-1.4_date.zip
----
This creates the `jacctck` directory. The install_directory`/``jacctck`
directory is the test suite home, `<TS_HOME>`.
3.  Install the JACC 1.5 Reference Implementation. +
The Reference Implementation is used to validate your initial
configuration and setup of the JACC TCK 1.5 tests, which are explained
further in link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration."] 
4.  Install the JACC Vendor Implementation (VI) to be tested. +
Follow the installation instructions for the particular VI under test.
