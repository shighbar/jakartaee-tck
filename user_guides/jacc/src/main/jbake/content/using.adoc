5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JACC TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the test
suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GCLRR[Running the JACC TCK Against the JACC RI]
* link:#GCLRZ[Running the JACC TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"]
respectively.

=======================================================================


[[GBFUZ]][[TCJAC00050]][[starting-javatest]]

5.1 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the JACC TCK using the JavaTest
harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI
* From the command line in your shell environment


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `ant` command referenced in the following two procedures refers to
the Ant build tool, which is included in the JACC TCK bundle. The
`build.xml` file in `<TS_HOME>/bin` contains the various Ant targets for
the JACC TCK test suite

=======================================================================


[[GBFWH]][[TCJAC00019]][[to-start-javatest-in-gui-mode]]

5.1.1 To Start JavaTest in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the `ant gui`
target:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant gui
----

[[GBFVW]][[TCJAC00020]][[to-run-the-jacc-tck-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.1.2 To Run the JACC TCK Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JACC TCK compatibility requirements can be met by performing the TCK
tests with an implementation of the following target platforms: an EJB
container, a Web container, or both EJB and Web containers as is the
case in the Java EE 7 RI. Keywords can be used to indicate in which
container specific tests should be run.

The following examples assume that you have already deployed the JACC
TCK EJB tests, Web tests, or both sets of tests. See Step 6 in
link:config.html#GCLHU[Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the JACC TCK Against Your JACC 1.5 Vendor Implementation,"] for more
information about deploying the JACC TCK tests.

5.2.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`ant`.

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the JACC TCK web or ejb tests with a
status of failed and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jacc/web|ejb
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

5.3 Running the JACC TCK Against the JACC RI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is ensures that the configuration and deployment of
all the JACC TCK tests against the JACC 1.5 Reference Implementation are
successful, and that the TCK is ready for compatibility testing against
the Vendor and JACC 1.5 Implementations.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GBFVU[Section 4.1, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the JACC TCK Against the JACC Reference Implementation."]
2.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GCLRZ]][[TCJAC00053]][[running-the-jacc-tck-against-a-vendors-implementation]]

5.4 Running the JACC TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is one of the compatibility test phases that all
Vendors must pass.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GCLHU[Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the JACC TCK Against Your JACC 1.5 Vendor Implementation."]
2.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GBFVK]][[TCJAC00054]][[test-reports]]

5.5 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.
