5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The JAX-RS TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute the tests in the
test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to run and use
JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in the
documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GCLRI[Overview]
* link:#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GCLRR[Running the JAX-RS TCK Against the RI]
* link:#GCLRZ[Running the JAX-RS TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"],
respectively.

=======================================================================


[[GCLRI]][[TCJRS00054]][[overview]]

5.1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained in link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Packaging the JAX-RS
TCK Test Applications in Servlet-Compliant WAR Files With VI-Specific
Information,"] the JAX-RS TCK introduces the concept of repackaging the
TCK tests.

[[GBFUZ]][[TCJRS00055]][[starting-javatest]]

5.2 Starting JavaTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the JAX-RS TCK using the JavaTest
harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI
* From the command line in your shell environment


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `<TS_HOME>/bin/ant` command referenced in the following two
procedures and elsewhere in this guide is a wrapper around the Ant build
tool, which is included in the JAX-RS TCK bundle. The `build.xml` file
in `<TS_HOME>/bin` contains the various Ant targets for the JAX-RS TCK
test suite

=======================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run a subset of the tests:

* link:#GBFVT[Section 5.3.1, "To Run a Subset of Tests in GUI Mode"]
* link:#GBFWK[Section 5.3.2, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line
Mode"]
* link:#GBFVL[Section 5.3.3, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode
Based on Prior Result Status"]

[[GBFVT]][[TCJRS00024]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-gui-mode]]

5.3.1 To Run a Subset of Tests in GUI Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the JavaTest main menu, click Configure, then click Change
Configuration, and then click Tests to Run. +
The tabbed Configuration Editor dialog box is displayed.
2.  Click Specify from the option list on the left.
3.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, and
then click Done. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively,
or select just a single test.
4.  Click Save File.
5.  Click Run Tests, and then click Start to run the tests you selected. +
Alternatively, you can right-click the test you want from the test tree
in the left section of the JavaTest main window, and choose Execute
These Tests from the menu.
6.  Click Report, and then click Create Report.
7.  Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click OK. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
8.  Click Yes to view the report.

[[GBFWK]][[TCJRS00025]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.3.2 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run. +
For example, `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxrs/api`.
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant runclient
----
The tests in `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxrs/api` and its
subdirectories are run.

[[GBFVL]][[TCJRS00026]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-batch-mode-based-on-prior-result-status]]

5.3.3 To Run a Subset of Tests in Batch Mode Based on Prior Result
Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run certain tests in batch mode based on the test's prior run
status by specifying the `priorStatus` system property when invoking
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ant`.

Invoke `ant` with the `priorStatus` property.

The accepted values for the `priorStatus` property are any combination
of the following:

* `fail`
* `pass`
* `error`
* `notRun`

For example, you could run all the JAX-RS tests with a status of failed
and error by invoking the following commands:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxrs
ant -DpriorStatus="fail,error" runclient
----

Note that multiple `priorStatus` values must be separated by commas.

5.4 Running the JAX-RS TCK Against the RI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is ensures that the configuration and deployment of
all the prebuilt JAX-RS TCK tests against the Reference Implementation
are successful, and that the TCK is ready for compatibility testing
against the Vendor and Reference Implementations.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GBFVU[Section 4.1, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the JAX-RS TCK Against the Reference Implementation."]
2.  Verify that you have completed the steps in
link:config.html#GCLIW[Section 4.3.2, "Deploying the JAX-RS TCK Prebuilt
Archives."]
3.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.2, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.3, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GCLRZ]][[TCJRS00058]][[running-the-jax-rs-tck-against-a-vendors-implementation]]

5.5 Running the JAX-RS TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is one of the compatibility test phases that all
Vendors must pass.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GCLHU[Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to
Repackage and Run the JAX-RS TCK Against the Vendor Implementation."]
2.  Verify that you have completed the steps in
link:config.html#GCLIL[Section 4.3.3, "Deploying the JAX-RS TCK Test
Applications Against the Vendor Implementation."]
3.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.2, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.3, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GBFVK]][[TCJRS00059]][[test-reports]]

5.6 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.
