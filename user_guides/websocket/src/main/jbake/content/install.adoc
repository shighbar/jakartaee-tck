3.1 Installing the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java API for WebSocket TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 7 or Java SE 8
* Java API for WebSocket implementation under test
* Servlet-compliant Web container or server that works with your
implementation of the Java API for WebSocket specification
* Java API for WebSocket TCK Version 1.0

1.  Install the Java SE 7 or Java SE 8 software, if it is not already
installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 7 or Java SE 8 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the Java API for WebSocket
implementation that is under test. To familiarize yourself with the test
suite and the JavaTest software before you begin testing with your own
implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the Java EE 7 RI
or the Java EE 7 Web Profile RI.
3.  Install the Java API for WebSocket TCK software.
1.  Copy or download the Java API for WebSocket TCK software to your
local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Java API
for WebSocket TCK software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip websockettck-1.0_<date>.zip
----
where <date> indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the Java API for WebSocket TCK bundle name could
be `websockettck-1.0_15-May-2013.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `websockettck` directory is created.
The install_directory`/``websockettck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
