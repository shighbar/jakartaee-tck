3.1 Installing the Java Persistence API Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run the Java Persistence API TCK tests, you need to
install and set up the following software components:

* Java SE 7
* Java Persistence API 2.2 Vendor Implementation (VI)
* Java Persistence API TCK Version 2.2

1.  Install the Java SE 7 software, if it is not already installed. +
Download and install the Java SE 7 software from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the software for
additional information.
2.  Install the implementation under test, if it is not already
installed. +
Download, install, and configure the JPA 2.2 configuration that is to be
tested. To familiarize yourself with the Java Persistence API TCK suite
and test environment before you begin testing with your own
implementation, you can optionally do a trial run using the JPA 2.2 RI.
3.  Install the JPA TCK 2.2 software.
1.  Copy or download the JPA TCK software to your local system.
2.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the JPA TCK
software: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
----
3.  Use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
unzip jpatck-2.2-date.zip
----
where date indicates the month and year in which the TCK bundle was
created. For example, the JPA TCK bundle name could be
`jpatck-2.2_15-June-2017.zip` +
When the bundle is unzipped, the `jpatck` directory is created. The
install_directory`/``jpatck` directory is the test suite home,
`<TS_HOME>`.
