4 Setup and Configuration
-------------------------

This chapter describes how to set up the JPA TCK and JavaTest harness
software and how to configure. Before proceeding with the instructions
in this chapter, be sure to install all required software, as described
in link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation."]

After completing the instructions in this chapter, proceed to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests,"] for instructions on
running the JPA TCK.

This section describes how to configure the JPA TCK for your
environment. After configuring your environment, continue with the
instructions in link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, use the appropriate separator
for your operating system when specifying multiple path entries (`;` on
Windows, `:` on Solaris/Linux).

4.1 To Configure Your Environment for the Java Persistence API TCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
1.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE 7 is installed
2.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the JPA TCK 2.2 software is
installed
3.  `PATH` to include the `<TS_HOME>/bin` , `JAVA_HOME/bin,` and
`<TS_HOME>/tools/ant/bin` directories
2.  Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and modify the following
properties:
1.  Set `jpa.classes` to include all of the necessary JAR files that
pertain to your implementation.
2.  Set `jdbc.lib.classpath` to the location where the JDBC drivers are
installed.
3.  Set `jdbc.db` to the name of the database under test. Valid values
include: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
derby
mysql
sybase
db2
mssqlserver
oracle
postgresql
----
4.  Set `javax.persistence.provider`, `javax.persistence.jdbc.driver`,
`javax.persistence.jdbc.url`, `javax.persistence.jdbc.user`, and
`javax.persistence.jdbc.password` to the appropriate values for the
database and persistence provider under test. +
These properties are passed to the Persistence provider during the
creation of the `EntityManagerFactory`. Any additional values, for
example setting an implementation's logging level, must be set by
following the instructions in Step 2e.
5.  Set the `jpa.provider.implementation.specific.properties` property
to include any implementation-specific settings that need to be passed
to the provider when the `EntityManagerFactory` is created.
6.  Set `sigTestClasspath` to include any additional classes not
specified with the `jpa.classes` property.
7.  Set `work.dir` to the default directory in which JavaTest writes
temporary files that are created during test execution. The default
location is <TS_HOME>/tmp/JTwork. +
This property is required for the TCK Ant targets.
8.  Set `report.dir` to the default directory in which JavaTest creates
a test report for the most recent test run. The default location is
<TS_HOME>/tmp/JTreport. +
This property is a required property for the TCK Ant targets; it must be
set. To disable reporting, set the `report.dir` property to `"none"`.
9.  Set db.supports.sequence to false if the database does not support
the use of SEQUENCE. +
The default value is true.
10. Set `persistence.second.level.caching.supported` to false if your
persistence provider does not support second level caching. +
The default value is true.
3.  If you are using MySQL or MS SQL Server, do the following:
1.  If you are using MySQL, see link:#GJLIB[Section 4.2, "Setup
Considerations for MySQL,"] and proceed to Step link:#BABGIFCH[4].
2.  If you are using MS SQL Server, see link:#GJLHU[Section 4.3, "Setup
Considerations for MS SQL Server,"] and proceed to Step
link:#BABGIFCH[4].
4.  [[BABGIFCH]] +
Start the database under test.
5.  Initialize the database under test. +
The `init.database` target initializes the database tables. +
Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the following
command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -f initdb.xml
----

4.2 Setup Considerations for MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java Persistence API (JPA) tests require delimited identifiers for
the native query tests. If you are using delimited identifiers on MySQL,
modify the `sql-mode` setting in the `my.cnf` file to set the
ANSI_QUOTES option. After setting this option, reboot the MySQL server.
Set the option as shown in this example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
sql-mode=
    "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,ANSI_QUOTES"
----

[[GJLHU]][[TCPER00067]][[setup-considerations-for-ms-sql-server]]

4.3 Setup Considerations for MS SQL Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your database already exists and if you use a case-sensitive
collation on MS SQL Server, execute the following command to modify the
database and avert errors caused by case-sensitive collation:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ALTER DATABASE ctsdb COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS ;
----
